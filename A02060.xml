            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are juſtly placed in a glorious ſphere, elevated in a moſt conſpicuous altitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other inferiour and ſubordinate Orbes, from whence (as a ſoveraign Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter) you behold and judge of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they either reliſh of worth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, and (like the Sunne) impartially diſpenſe the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beames of your favour, as well to the humbleſt plant, as the talleſt Cedar. As I am a recent and freſh exiſtent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of your life-tendring influence, for when depreſſed and trampled upon by the inſolency of an unkinde-adverſary
<pb facs="tcp:7066:3"/> that raiſed me up to tread upon an equall Baſis with him, who lately had deſigned me for his foot-ſtoole. An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of Clemency and Iuſtice, eminent vertues, and truely inherent in your moſt Royall boſome: for which with all humility I bow, and thankfulneſſe acknowledge, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely honouring them ſo conſpicuous in your Majeſty, and by you ſo frequently exerciſed. Thus reſtor'd, I come charg'd with a Booke, which I moſt humbly proſtrate at your feete, becauſe I feare it is not conſcious of ſo much worth, as to merit a kiſſe from your ſacred hand. It is the Embrion of my ſtudy, travels, experience, and practiſe, and cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to forme and perfection without the reflection of your Majeſties favour. It brings with it a front not altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, of <hi>Horſmanſhip</hi> and <hi>Ferriery;</hi> the firſt not incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the moſt illuſtrious title and Heroick Spirit; the ſecond not unworthy the knowledge, yea the practiſe of the moſt accompliſh'd Gentleman. I know this Treatiſe cannot hold proportion with ſo elated a patronage, as that of your Majeſty, although it were inform'd with a farre nobler Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; yet for all this infinite diſproportion, the Dedication of it unto your ſacred Majeſty will not appeare much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; for firſt I received the ability to proſecute it from your Grace and favour: ſo that deriving its being from you, it belongs of right unto you, and muſt have recourſe unto your Majeſtie for its ſafety and protection. Secondly, it is the off-ſpring of my age, and cannot but leave a fatall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in its Parents infirmity, and therefore (eſpecially in theſe cenſorious times) cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt without your Royall protection. Laſtly, as you have taken the rationall creatures of this your tripartite Kingdome into your titular care, ſo have you not excluded the irrationall, albeit in a different condition, much leſſe the <hi>Horſe,</hi> whoſe Generoſity, and uſe have given him the precedency in your Majeſties eſteeme, before all other bruit ſpecies; ſo that this Booke (which beautifies his ſhape, encreaſes his courage, delivers rudiments for his menage, preſcribes cures for his diſeaſes,
<pb facs="tcp:7066:3"/> and in all, enables and advances his race and bravery) hopes to finde your Majeſties hand extended and open to receive it. The worke concernes the Common-wealth in generall, and if accepted and peruſed with as much zeale and care as I have us'd in the publiſhing of it; I preſume it will not be found empty of profit. My many yeares have given me the priviledge to have ſeene and knowne this kingdome rich both in the number and quality of her Horſes, and it would infinitely grieve me that I now live to ſee her reduc'd to ſo deplorable an indignity, but that I am confident I ſhall ſee her reſtor'd to her precedent glory and opulency by your Majeſty: and now that I have aſſum'd the boldneſſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate her poverty, my zeale and reſpect to my Country, tranſports me yet a little further to diſcover the cauſes of it, together with the redreſſes and remedies. Firſt, thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, Parks, Commons, Fennes, Moores, and other marriſh and waſte grounds, which paid yearely ſo rich a tribute of young, able, and ſerviceable Horſes to the univerſall uſe of this Kingdome, are at this time diſafforreſted, diſpark't, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, drain'd, laid dry, and converted to other (but much different) uſes, ſo that thoſe brave breeds and races of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are much extenuated, or altogether intermitted. Then the Gelders, who in every ſhire ſo confidently and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe their faculty in a moſt unlawfull manner, and ſpay yong Fillies, by which meanes they become barren, the breeds of Horſes diſcontinued, and the Common-wealth highly prejudic'd and unfurniſh'd; for inſtance I can and will (upon occaſion) produce a Gelder who ſpayes more then a hundred Fillies. For redreſſe of the firſt, your Majeſty may be pleaſed to command that thoſe Statutes which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted for the breeding of Horſes, may be ſpeedily and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly put in execution. For the ſecond, that you will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pleaſe by your Proclamation to inhibit all Gelders that unlawfull and prejudiciall exerciſe of their profeſſion, then ſhall your Majeſty ſee the noxious and exorbitant diſeaſe meet with a ſudden and eaſie cure, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:7066:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> derive a ſenſible and ineſtimable benefit from it. Now it reſts that I make an humble Apologie for my boldneſſe, which indeed would be a matter of trouble and difficulty for me to accompliſh; did I not know your Majeſtie to be a Prince infinitely tendring the good and welfare of your Kingdome; ſo that this treating of a buſineſſe not inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, I deſpaire not of obtaining your Royall pardon, but promiſe my ſelfe from your benignity and clemency, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious acceptance of that I have moſt zealouſly delivered.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I doe conſider <hi>(benevolent Reader)</hi> the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience whereinto that Man is plunged, who brings himſelfe upon the publique Stage of promulgating his Bookes in print, be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject never ſo laudable, and the Author no leſſe cautelous and ſufficient, endeavouring with all diligence to prevent the brand of a black cole: nevertheleſſe all induſtry applyed, he ſhall not paſſe without oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy and aſperſion.</p>
            <p>This very conſideration hath ſo afrighted and deterred me, that albeit I have had many great motives exciting me to make a tender of the Love, Duty, and Service I beare to my Country; yet when I doe contemplate the many cenſures I muſt undergoe, I have beene evermore diſheartened as well from beginning, as going forwards in this my deſired purpoſe. Notwithſtanding partly through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I beare to my Countries profit and honour, and partly by meanes of the importunity of many my right Noble and generous friends, who have been eye-witneſſes to ſundry of my Cures, and thoſe not a few uncouth and rare: I have adventured even now in my declining dayes, to leave this Work as a Monument to enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, no whit doubting, but that the judicious will friendly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof; but as for the malevolent and ignorant, I am moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the quils they ſhall dart at me, cannot goe as from a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine, and therefore will do me the leſſe hurt or domage.</p>
            <p>I therefore am bold to put into thy hand, this poore work of mine, which I have digeſted into tw Bookes: In the firſt, I lay thee down rudiments how thou mayeſt breed Horſes to thy beſt advantage and liking; which albeit they may appeare unto thee to be recent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, yet if thou wilt be pleaſed to put them in ure, and make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (not digreſſing from my principles) thou wilt (I doe aſſure me) be ſo farre from diſliking them, as never hereafter to ſwarve or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from them. For if we ſhall ſeriouſly ruminate in how high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme that man is who is owner and poſſeſſor of good Horſes, how much commended, how much reſpected, how much talked of, and how well proffered for them: but when he ſhall be knowne to be a
<pb facs="tcp:7066:7"/> breeder of ſuch good Horſes, will not his <hi>encomiums</hi> be the greater? but when together with theſe himſelfe ſhall be known to be exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in Horſemanſhip, whereby to cauſe his Horſe to ſhew himſelfe in his Pace, Menage, and all other his poſtures like as well becomes a right good Horſe, perfectly mouthed, delicately borne, obedient to the hand, and to anſwer the Switch and Spur, will not (I ſay) that Gentleman be highly commended, and have more eyes upon him as he paſſeth a long, than are commonly caſt upon a Comet or the Sun eclipſed? yes undoubtedly. For if we doe but note when a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Horſe paſſeth along, we may obſerve the people not onely gaze upon him as he commeth towards and againſt them, but to turn themſelves and looke after him ſo long time as he continueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their view and ſight: Mans love to the Horſe is generally ſo great.</p>
            <p>Sithence then the Horſe is a creature ſo generous, and therefore ſo much liked and beloved of all, in my poore judgement, it ſhould ſuit very well with every Gentleman of worth, ranke, and quality, to endeavour (if not to breed, yet at leaſt) to be maſters of ſuch Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (which he muſt keep) that ſhall be truely handſome and comely, rightly bred, of good colour, cleane ſhape, well marked, and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well ridden and made, and ſo he ſhall the better advance his honour and reputation.</p>
            <p>Having now bred, or otherwiſe by thy diligent endeavours attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto ſuch Horſes as be truely good, and for thy turne; the ſecond thing to be thought of, is, if they be not already made unto thy hand as thou deſireſt to have them, that thou then doe procure ſuch a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who is known to be a maſter of his Art, or otherwiſe thou wilt be much deceived, and farre to ſeeke of enjoying thy wiſhed deſires, and therefore I have given thee inſtructions how to make thy choice of ſuch a man, whereby thou ſhalt not be wronged in thy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor thy Horſe marred in his firſt making and handling. Neither have I taken upon me to teach him his Art, (for that were a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impertinent) but thoſe documents which I have ſet thee downe muſt ſerve onely to ſhew thee how thou ſhouldeſt ſoone finde whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Rider may be for thy turne or not.</p>
            <p>The third thing which thou art to take to thy conſideration, is, the good or harme that may come unto thee by the choice thou makeſt of thy Groome or Keeper, who may either through his ignorance, or inconſideration, ſoone make him unfit both for thy owne uſe, or any mans elſe: out of which reaſon I have depainted thee a Groom in his lively colours, and if his conditions and qualities ſhall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than what I have delineated, aſſure thy ſelfe thou doſt runne a manifeſt hazard of marring that Horſe thou didſt hope ſhould have been to thy hearts deſire. And foraſmuch as it is a matter very much praiſe-worthy to be a Maſter of good Horſes, to have them made perfect and ready, to have ſuch Riders, Keepers, and Groomes, as be
<pb facs="tcp:7066:7"/> very perite in their faculties; yet if thy Stable be not every way ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and correſpondent, much diſprofit and inconvenience may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſoone redound to thy Horſe. I have therefore preſcribed thee the meanes how thou mayeſt have a perfect and good Stable, with all commodities and accoutrements thereunto belonging: and therefore if thou wilt be pleaſed to make uſe of theſe my rudiments, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obſerve theſe my grounds and principles, aſſure thy ſelfe thou wilt in ſhort time aſpire to that which will be thy honour and renown.</p>
            <p>And to the end thou mayeſt the more perfectly and eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the full drift and ſumme of this my firſt Booke, I will here give unto thee an Epitome of it in a few lines, which may doe thee much pleaſure in the peruſall thereof.</p>
            <p>In the Introduction, I ſhew thee how needfull a creature the Horſe is beyond all others, and what admirable things Horſes in former times have perpetrated and done, whereof I produce thee inſtances of the famous acts of ſundry brave and generous Horſes, whoſe love to their Maſters have been ſo great great, as hardly to be credited, if ancient Hiſtories and Annals of good integrity, had not engraven them in the memory of never-dying poſterity. We reade of <hi>Bucepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> what he did for the good, life, and ſafety of his Maſter; of the Horſe of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> with what undaunted courage he comported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in battell for the reliefe and ſuccour of his Lord; it is recorded alſo of the Horſe of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> what ill ſucceſſe befell <hi>Centurettus,</hi> who when he had ſlaine <hi>Antiochus,</hi> would needs backe the Horſe of his ſlaine Maſter. It is alſo noted what inly love <hi>Nicomedes</hi> his Horſe bare to his Lord and Maſter, when after his death of meere griefe, famiſhed himſelfe. We reade of <hi>Aethon,</hi> the Horſe of <hi>Pallas,</hi> who was evidently obſerved and ſeen to weep at the funerall of his Maſter. <hi>Silius</hi> makes report of two famous Horſes called <hi>Pelorus</hi> and <hi>Ciraeus,</hi> the one eminent for his proweſſe and hardineſſe in warre, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his unparalelled ſwiftneſſe. Moreover we may reade, how that this poore creature hath ſo well merited of man, as that many have erected Monuments and Sepulchers, celebrated Exequies, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and founded munificent Cities, ſet up Pyramidies, made Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs, erected goodly Statues, inſtituted Playes and Games; and all theſe in honour of the Horſe; beſides many other remarkable things right worthy of note.</p>
            <p>In the way of Breeding, I do intimate unto thee the manner how, the ſeaſon when, the place where, together with the colours, marks, and ſhapes as well of thy Stalions, as of thy Race, or Stud Mares, and from what defects they muſt be free: what Signes are beſt wherein to cover, what courſe to take with them that they may conceive, what exerciſe is fitteſt for them as well when they be with Fole, as after foling; how to cheriſh thy Mares when their Colts ſhall runne by them, and how to breed up thy Colts till they come to handling,
<pb facs="tcp:7066:8"/> backing, and riding, with other circumſtances very neceſſary to be known: and thus much briefly for the firſt Book.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Booke conſiſteth chiefly of the manner how thou mayeſt cure all ſuch diſeaſes and maladies (both intrinſecall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall) whereunto either the life of the Horſe, or any of his limbs or members may be any way endamaged or in danger. This I have handled by way of familiar Dialogue, which I hold to be beſt, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding of prolix and over-tedious diſcourſes, by reaſon it will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much help the memory of the Reader, and keep his minde the better attent upon the ſtate of the Queſtion or ſubject in hand, and by that meanes I may my ſelfe be the better able alſo to explicate and deliver my meaning, much more cleerely. In which Dialogue, I have introduced as prolocutors, three perſons onely, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophilus</hi> a Gentleman, one who is the true lover of the Horſe: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Hippiatrus</hi> the Ferrier or Mariſhall, one moſt expert in Horſe-leech craft: And thirdly, <hi>Hippoſerus</hi> his Servant or Iourney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſometimes his apprentice bred up by him, from whom <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerus</hi> hath had his education and knowledge in this Art: theſe be all the <hi>Dramatis perſonae</hi> to this Scene. Wherefore in the firſt Chapter, I doe endeavour to illuſtrate unto thee the true Office of the Ferrier, wherein I do produce an exact examen of his function.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Chapter, I do inculcate as well the cauſes of health as of ſickneſſe, wherein I make an abridgement of all thoſe things which all learned Phyſitians and Chirurgions (both antient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern do from the grounds and principles of profound Philoſophy) finde to govern and beare rule in the body of the Horſe, without which he can have no fleſh, bones, ſinewes, bloud, or life it ſelfe, wherewith to make up the entire ſtructure of an orginall body, and ſuch are firſt the Elements; ſecondly, the Humours, thirdly, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculties; fourthly, the inſtrumentall members; fifthly, the ſpirits animall; ſixtly, the ſpirits vitall; ſeventhly, the naturall parts, and ſo of the reſidue. And having ſufficiently diſcuſſed all theſe things in due order and method, I do then ſhew thee what meanes we have to preſerve the Horſe from all inward diſeaſes, which I doe finde to be foure in number, <hi>viz.</hi> By Purge, by Sweat, by Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and by Vomit: and then I do proceed to inculcate unto thee the cauſes of health and long life, which I do make to be in number twelve, which if thou do well obſerve, they will redound to thy great utility and profit.</p>
            <p>In the third Chapter I do demonſtrate certaine things moſt befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Ferrier to know and underſtand well, before he ſhall take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to adminiſter: in the handling whereof I do begin firſt with the foure Elements, anatomizing unto thee their true natures and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and how and where they be ſcituate, things moſt needfull to be known; then I goe along with the two proper Elements, ſhewing from whence the ſeed and menſtruall bloud is ingendred, then I paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:7066:8"/> forwards in intreating of the foure Humours, explaining their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and vertues, poynting unto the places of their abode and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and what relation and coherence they have unto the foure Complexions, I do alſo ſhew thee what are the two ſpirits animall, and the two vitall, their natures vertues, and places of abode and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in the body of the Horſe. After all this I ſhew thee, that by duly obſerving the complexion of the Horſe thou art to cure, thou mayeſt thereby the ſooner, better, and with more ſecurity and eaſe, perfect thy Cure; nay, I goe yet further with thee, in ſhewing unto thee an exact way whereby to know by the complexion it ſelfe, the diſeaſes whereunto the Horſe is moſt propenſe; then I make known what be the cauſes of the evill diſpoſitions of the Horſe, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and begetteth unavoydable infirmity and ſickneſſe, whereof they be two in number, <hi>viz.</hi> Intrinſecall and Extrinſecall, together with a definition of the nature of ſickneſſe; and ſo I go along in teaching thee the manner how thou oughteſt to adminiſter ſuch Drinks, Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Cliſters, and Medicines, without any the leaſt perill to thy Horſe, as alſo the time of the day moſt ſuteable to that purpoſe: and what exerciſe is moſt requiſite to be had after Phyſicke or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. And laſtly I come to touch briefly upon his urine and ordure, whereby to give the rules infallible how to know and underſtand the true ſtate of the body of the Horſe as well in health as in ſickneſſe.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Chapter of this ſecond Book, I do begin to handle the Cures in particular, wherein I run a courſe by my ſelfe, which I have not known any before me undertake: for whereas Maſter <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devile,</hi> Maſter <hi>Markham,</hi> and others, do begin with all the inward diſeaſes which are to be cured by way of Phyſicke, and then with the outward maladies which doe appertain unto Chirurgery; I have thought it much better to take the diſeaſes Alphabetically, mixing the extrinſecall with the intrinſecall, by which meanes they will the ſooner and more eaſily be found, and turned unto more readily. And whereſoever you ſhall finde this <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> mark inſerted in the end of any cure, I have ſet the ſame there, to let you know that receit to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, and approved for good and certaine, being by my ſelfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten practiſed and uſed. And thoſe receits that have not the mark, are ſuch Cures which I did procure from ſundry able Ferriers, whereof I have had no tryall or experience at all, for want of time and means, and therefore dare not avouch or cry them up for mathematicall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they do appear unto me to be probably good, but by reaſon I have not tryed them, I would not adventure a <hi>probatum,</hi> or <hi>ecce</hi> upon them. Nevertheleſſe if God permit me to reprint, I doubt not but by that time to give them for approved and warrantable, and to adde many more unto them which I have already by me, which I do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to publiſh at this preſent, albeit I do know many of them to be as probably good as any of thoſe.</p>
            <p>In the other Chapters I goe cleane through the whole Alphabet,
<pb facs="tcp:7066:9"/> according to that Method uſed in that 4th. Chapter; and therfore let this abſtract ſuffice for the preſent. And foraſmuch as I have diſcuſſed the former things of Breeding, &amp;c. in my firſt Booke: Yet my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not at the firſt to trench ſo deepe into that ſubject, but to ſhew principally the <hi>Ferriers</hi> Craft and Art, out of an earneſt deſire I have to excite &amp; ſtir up our yong Gentlemen to aſſume ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Myſtery ſo neceſſary for them to apprehend, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to have a glimpſe of, conſidering how rare a thing it is to finde a skilfull <hi>Ferrier</hi> among our rurall or Countrey <hi>Smiths.</hi> For if the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility &amp; Gentry of this our Ile of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> did truly know how honourable, and how commendable Horſemanſhip were, and how much they are eſteemed and admired, who are the true profeſſours thereof, they would labour more than they now doe, to breed and have good Horſes; but it much troubleth me to ſee how little eſteeme Gentlemen now a dayes have thereof. Some Horſes they have, though not for Menage, yet for Hunting; but what manner of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Fox-hunting forſooth, or Harriers which be as fleete as petty Grey-hounds wherewith they do ſo much over-ſtraine the ſtrength of their poore Horſes (forcing them over deepe-Fallowes, tough-Clayes, and wet and rough Lands) that albeit thoſe Horſes be ſtrong and able, yet are they ſo toyled out therewith, as that when they come home at night, they would pitty the heart of him who loveth a Horſe, to ſee them ſo be mired, blouded, ſpurred, lamentably ſpent, and tyred out: Whereas if ſuch Horſes had beene ridden to the great Saddle and Cannon, they would have infinitely delighted all men who ſhould have beheld them.</p>
            <p>But let mee leave them vnto their toyleſome ſports, and let my ſpeech bee directed to ſuch Heroique and Generous Spirits, who have a deſire to informe and better their underſtanding in the ſecrets of this brave Myſterie; who if they have a will to bee edoctrinated therein, then for a Mathematicall ground of true Horſe-manſhip, I muſt tell them, that they having and poſſeſſing of good Horſes, yea and Riding it ſelf is little worth without the knowledge of the <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Craft, at the leaſt in the Theorique or Speculative part, if not in the Practique: and therefore I could wiſh that every worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſhould have a good inſight thereinto, albeit he doth not make it his Trade, Occupation; or frequent practiſe and profeſſion. Yet it will not be amiſſe, he be able to know every diſeaſe in a Horſe, its Symtomes, and how it commeth, together with the true ſigne therof, which indeed is a matter of very great conſequence. For when a Nobleman <hi>(V. G.)</hi> Knight, or Gentleman ſhall have a Horſe that doth well merit his affection, and which ſhall be for his turne, if any accident or Malady ſhall befall him, albeit he may not himſelfe take upon him the Cure, and to Drench, Bloudy, or Dreſſe him with his owne hands; yet (ſending for a <hi>Ferrier</hi>) he may diſcourſe with him upon the Nature of the Diſeaſe, and thereby come to underſtand
<pb facs="tcp:7066:9"/> whether the <hi>Ferrier</hi> ſpeaketh according to Art or not, and whether his intended courſe of adminiſtring, be anſwerable to true Art &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Science, and probably a ſecure way to perfect the Cure; ſo as if the Maſter and Owner of the Horſe be not himſelfe enabled with ſome ſuperficiall knowledge at the leaſt, at what time he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with the <hi>Ferrier,</hi> if not, (I ſay) able to iudge of the Mans ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency (the Smith himſelfe being indeed inſufficient) by miſtaking the Infirmity, he may ignorantly adminiſter or apply ſuch contrary Medicine, whereby inſteed of labouring to cure him, hee ſhall moſt eaſily and infallibly kill him, to the no ſmall regreet and griefe of the Owner.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ferriers</hi> and <hi>Smiths</hi> may peradventure greatly repine, and grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the publication of this Worke of mine, like as to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; in my hearing, they have moſt virulently exclaimed, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently inveighed againſt Maſter <hi>Blundevile,</hi> Maſter <hi>Markham,</hi> and others, wiſhing their Bookes burned, and the Authours at the Goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyere, for publiſhing and Printing them: pretending much wrong to be done, to ſuch poore men who have ſerved Apprentiſhips to the Trade, having none other way or meanes of livelyhood but onely this. But hereunto I anſwere, that theſe Men have no cauſe at all to feare any preiudice thereby; and I dare boldly affirme the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Bookes will be ſo far from their harme or hinderance as that it will be infinitly to their benefit: for when they ſhall find any one Nobleman, Knight, or Gentleman who will undergoe ſo much paines as eyther to Bloudy, Drench, Coroſive, Cauterize, apply Cataplaſines, Emplayſters, Powders, Vnguents, or the like to his Horſe, whatſoever he hath attained unto by reading, or otherwiſe; you ſhall have a thouſand who upon any the leaſt occaſion will ſend for a <hi>Ferrier</hi> to take the Cure in hand. Againe, inſteed of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended preiudice, this commodity will accrew to my brethren <hi>Smiths, Mariſhalls,</hi> and <hi>Ferriers, viz.</hi> they ſhall (by promulgation of Bookes of this Nature) become much more able, and <hi>Imbui in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dijs,</hi> that is, much more learned and indoctrinated in this generous Faculty then ever they were before, by which meanes they will bee eſteemed much more famous and eminent, and cryed up for moſt expert and able Men in this Noble Science. For how commeth it to paſſe, that Phyſitians, Chyrurgions, Lawyers, Divines, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Artiſts doe become ſo great Doctors of their Arts and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and admired for moſt famous and learned Men, and ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetly ſought after, enquired out, and ſent for when occaſion is? Is it not for what they have attained unto by ſtudy and reading, untill which time they were not ſo hardy as to adventure upon practiſe? ſo as without their Library, they could never have been able to have attained unto that eminent knowledge they have afterwards aſpired unto; neyther could they otherwiſe have beene poſſibly able to practiſe and worke by true Art and Science. For the Workes of
<pb facs="tcp:7066:10"/> learned and eminent Men, is the only thing that doth enable them, which are left as a never-dying Monument to enſuing and endleſſe Poſterity, as the common good to the weale publique, even to all enſuing Ages: Imitating therein the ancient Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> that when any man had invented that thing which was knowne to bee commodious to the Re-publique, leaſt the thing ſhould bee buryed with the Inventer, and by that meanes taked up with him in the aſhes of perpetuall oblivion: they ordained that the firſt Inventer ſhould ſet up his Science be or knowne by way of Record in their publique Schooles in ſpacious Tables and in Capitall Characters of gold with with this Impreſſe, or Title, <hi>viz.</hi>

Wherefore that thing (I ſay) whereat I do principally ayme, is to publiſh the true Art of the <hi>Ferrier,</hi> a Faculty wherein I have beene daily verſed, and diligently practiſed for more than forty yeares, and that unto my no ſmall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and expence: and I doe well aſſure my ſelfe that peradverture no one Gentleman in this our Kingdome more, who hath done greater, more difficult, or deſperate Cures.</p>
            <p>During the time of my travels, I have for my better indemnity, not only peruſed what Authours I cold meete with, who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon this Subject; but I did alſo make my ſelfe an Eye witneſſe to the Cures of the moſt famous <hi>Mariſhals</hi> and <hi>Ferriers,</hi> the Cities, and places afforded where I came, omitting no diligence which might informe or enable my knowledge: neyther would I bee too credulous, or give too much beliefe to fame or reports, for we have a Maxime in the civill-Law, which ſaith: <hi>Fama p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For the common Proverb is; <hi>Qui facile credit, Facile decipitur.</hi> He that eaſily believeth, is eaſily deceived. And truly thus much I am able to ſpeake, that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> (for that in thoſe two places I had moſt commerce and experience, albeit I travelled many other parts of Chriſtendome) were the two Kingdomes in which I found the beſt, ableſt, and moſt expert <hi>Mariſhalls,</hi> or <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> but of all the places where ever yet I came, I am able of my own knowledge to ſay thus much (and that with no ſmall griefe) that the worſt <hi>Ferriers</hi> generally I doe find to be thoſe who are of our owne Nation: nevertheleſſe, I do not conclude or condemne all for inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, for ſome there be well knowne unto me very quaint and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert <hi>Ferriers,</hi> who can worke very well, and according to true Art and Method. I have therefore in this illaborat Work of mine given you ſeverall Receipts for every Cure, and moſt of them approved by my perticular practiſe and experience; Others againe I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb facs="tcp:7066:10"/> which are the Cures of other able men, which by reaſon they do ſound probable unto me, I have ſuffred them to paſſe among my owne, (though I never had meanes or opportunity to make triall of them.) And the reaſon why I have inculcated ſo many ſeverall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts to each Cure, are two; <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt becauſe that Receipt which will Cure one diſeaſe, will not alwaies cure the ſame Malady in an other Horſe. Secondly, you ſhall find ſome Receipts eyther very difficile to make, or the Ingredients not eaſie to be gotten, otherwiſe they prove more chargeable than the Owner of the Horſe is well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defray: and therefore I have given the Receipts for all ſorts and degrees of Horſes; howbeit thoſe Receipts which are moſt coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intricate to make and compound are commonly the very beſt, and worketh the beſt effects, and therefore I leave thee to thy ſelfe to make thy owne choyce.</p>
            <p>Now if any man ſhall ſay, that I have robbed or rifled other mens labours: I anſwere, I have not robbed, but approved them: for by the ſame rule I may as well object, that whoſoever worketh by my Booke robbeth me, for if that be theft, I pray what Phyſition is there in the whole world, (promulgating his Science) may not be as much cenſured and accuſed for rifling the Aphoriſmes of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi> yea and of others the Ancients and Moderne Authours alſo. But howſoever, I am ſo far from traducing other mens endeavours, as that I doe both reverence and admire them, and eſteeme my ſelfe unworthy their Scholler. But I know no reaſon why I may not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my knowledge of this Noble Art, for what ſaith a venerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour <hi>Qui ſe dicit ſcire quod neſcit, temerarius eſt: et qui negat ſcire quod ſcit, ingratus eſt.</hi> As that man is to be accompted for moſt temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and raſh, that ſhall take upon him to know that which in truth he knoweth not; ſo alſo doth he ſhew himſelfe to be moſt ingrate, who denyeth to know that thing which truly he doth know. Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are the grounds which may be laid to the rearing of this Structure, which being ſo well knowne to all, by ſetting each downe in perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I ſhall therein but only <hi>Siſyphi ſaxum volvere;</hi> conſume much time (which to me is moſt pretious) and labour to little purpoſe, and leſſe profit; and therefore I will in this diſcourſe draw towards an end, leaſt I might tire thee out with too long an Epiſtle; Yet leſſe I thought I could not inculcate, by reaſon there are many things in this worthy and noble Science, which might otherwiſe ſeeme to be very darke and abſtruſe, and the Cures I have (I ſay) carryed Dialogu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-wiſe, <hi>Ne inquam et inquit ſaepius interponeretur;</hi> meerly to avoyd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith well; <hi>Omne Ens naturaliter appetit ſuam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem.</hi> Every <hi>Ens,</hi> that is to ſay; Every man hath a naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to arrive unto that perfection to which hee hath a will or deſire to underſtand.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon why I did enterlace my firſt Book with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and perfections which Horſes in former times have atchieved,
<pb facs="tcp:7066:11"/> as alſo with ſuch rules and principles of breeding, ſhape, marks, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, &amp;c. was, leſt otherwiſe I might be like to one who telleth a ſick man of a ſoveraign medicine for his infirmity, and yet conceales from him the uſe thereof. And therefore I doe make it my chiefeſt deſire, and principall intention, yea my obligation, not onely to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate each diſeaſe, together with its cure, but alſo to make up all the attributes belonging to a perfect Horſe, and ſuch defects which be incident to ſo noble and uſefull a creature, being likewiſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>If therefore it may pleaſe thee ſometimes to retire thy ſelfe in the peruſall of this Treatiſe, and with due and ſerious judgement, not ſo much to reflect upon the method and forme of this world, as of the matter or ſubject it ſelfe, then I doubt not but that thou wilt receive ſuch benefit and contentment, as that thereby thou wilt be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and enabled in thy underhanding, both for the breeding and well ordering of young Horſes, and in the cure of every of their maladies.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as I have brought this my firſt work to its period, which I may rightly reſemble to a Structure or Building, my ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care hath been to make it faire and beautifull to the eye, and to grace, garniſh, and ſet it forth with varieties of divers ſorts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have been very diligent to give it all ſatisfaction I have been able, and therefore I have laboured to paint and poliſh it forth with what variety is moſt neceſſary for ſo exquiſite a building.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſithence nothing more imports a building, then to lay a ſure and ſubſtantiall foundation, and withall to make the wals ſo tite and impregnable, as to be able to reſiſt not ſo much winde and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the violence, aſſaults, and battery of detracting enemies: my care therefore hath been to have it founded and ſcituate upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Rock of a pregnant truth. And therrfore conſidering I have applyed all this paines, and ſpent ſo much time and coſt, which I might have otherwiſe both imployed and applyed to my more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commodity, by which I have not onely finiſhed this Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and made it commodious for thee, but I do alſo preſent it unto thee meerely for thy proper uſe and habitation; and therefore I hope that thou wilt not make ſuch uſe thereof, as men do of an Inne, where he taketh a bait or repaſt, for one meale, or for a lodging, for one night, and away, to wit, by onely taking a ſuperficiall view thereof: but that thou wilt make it thy abode, at the leaſt for ſome time; I meane, by reading and digeſting the whole worke in order as it lyeth treatably and ſeriouſly, and after by putting in practiſe what therein thou ſhalt finde to be fit for thy uſe; ſo ſhalt thou reape, and enjoy the benefit; my ſelfe the comfort, and the Common-wealth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>If any leakes be in the printing, impute them either unto the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of the Printer, or elſe to the negligence of him unto whom
<pb facs="tcp:7066:11"/> the charge of the correcting was committed; and if any be in the Author, let the fault light upon thoſe who ſpurred him ſo faſt on to haſte it to the Preſſe; but howſoever ſhew thy charity in correcting the faults and ſlips, as well of the one, as of the other: So ſhalt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to the world like thy ſelfe, truely Noble, and oblige the Author to remaine ever thy humble Servant, and true Friend: Farewell.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we will but take to our ſerious conſideration how many great obligations we have to admire the infinite goodneſſe of Almighty God in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating ſuch a marvellous number of creatures, meerely for the uſe and ſervice of man, whereof no one of them can be wanting; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, we have none more uſefull, or which can be leſſe ſpared, then the Horſe; no dumb creature more generous, nor any that commeth ſo neere unto the pleaſure of man, none can ſerve him better in time of peace and warre, none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for manuring and tilling the earth, and to cauſe it to produce its fruits; none more uſefull for bringing in the fruits of the earth; none more behoofefull to beare and carry him his long and tedious jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, in heat and cold, through thick and thin, by night and day; none better to carry him from danger, and to land his maſter at the port of ſafety, then the Horſe: and for his paſtimes and recreations, no creature to be compared to this: neither is there any creature created by the great Creator of all things, which doth ſo perfectly underſtand and connive with the nature and minde of man, or that beareth a more inly love to man, as doth this poore creature the Horſe; for upon all occaſions he ſweateth, he trudgeth, he toyleth, he drudgeth, he moyleth, he laboureth <hi>pro viribus,</hi> with great alacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty and cheerefulneſſe (ſo long as his vitall ſpirits laſt) to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and content to him that feedeth and cheriſheth him, yea and that (I ſay) with ſuch joy and alacrity, as if (like to a reaſonable creature) he found himſelfe obliged thereto in the bond of all ſincere duty and gratitude. For ſhould I ſpeake rather like a Philoſopher then a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, I could not but agnize nature to be admirable in all her works,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7066:16"/> wherein man doth owe unto her infinite, and thoſe very great thanks, in that ſhe hath accommodated and plentifully furniſhed him with all things needfull for his uſe, as alſo in that ſhe hath propagated (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all other) the Horſe, the moſt uſefull for the ſervice of man, and who beſt acknowledgeth his Maſter. And that this may be the better anatomized, I will ſhew you what I finde recorded by authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Authors of the excellency of this praiſe-worthy creature.</p>
               <p>The ſo much-renowned <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> who carried his Maſter through ſo many conquered kingdomes, ſerves for an example to all enſuing ages, who would not ſuffer any man but great <hi>Alexander</hi> to backe him, who ſeemed to be proud at what time he carried ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and victorious a charge, and it is alſo written of him, that being wounded at the ſiege and ſacking of <hi>Thebes,</hi> he carried him couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly through the troops and throngs of all the combatants, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible valour and courage, nothing at all eſteeming or prizing the loſſe of his bloud, being moſt deſirous, and no leſſe willing to do his maſter all faithfull ſervice, to the utmoſt of his power, and to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the laſt drop of his bloud, labouring to purchaſe unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his (not to be parallelled) valour, and his reſolute perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, a victorious advantage over the enemy. What never-dying high renown, the horſe of <hi>Caeſar</hi> got, I hold little inferiour to that of <hi>Bucephalus? Dionyſius</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Sicily,</hi> in a great and well fought battell, was himſelfe ſo hard put to it, that he was conſtrained to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his horſe, nevertheleſſe the poore beaſt made his way through the throngs of the enemy; who all bloudy and miery as he was, gat him to a randevous his Stable. <hi>Centaurettus</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> having in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile flaine <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he in a bravado mounted his horſe, who ſoone found by good experience, (albeit no whit to his advantage) that the ſaid horſe retained a reſentment of the death of his ſlaine Maſter, for the horſe ſo ſoone as he felt this his new Lord upon his back, never gave ouer flinging, yarking, plunging, and bownding, commanding the Bit with his teeth, launching out ſometimes this way, ſometimes that way, with ſo great impetuoſity and fury, that at length he caſt his raſh rider to the earth, and then fell to him with his heeles, redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his ſtrokes in ſo thick and violent a manner, not giving over till he had ſlain him out-right, whereby he gave him little cauſe to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and glory in his temerarious attempt. We reade of <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> whoſe Horſe ſo intirely loved him, as that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was no ſooner dead, but the Horſe preſently forſooke his meat, and ſo continued, untill ſuch time as he languiſhing for very griefe, dyed of famine. <hi>Virgil,</hi> the Prince of Poets, maketh honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aethon,</hi> the Horſe of <hi>Pallas,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Evander,</hi> who ſaith that this <hi>Aethon</hi> being preſent at the funerall of his maſter, wept for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as theſe two verſes do inculcate:

                  <hi>Silius Italicus</hi> in his ninth Book, doth highly extoll two horſes, to wit, <hi>Pelorus</hi> and <hi>Ciraeus,</hi> ſpeaking of them in this manner:
<q>
                     <l>Ready <hi>Pelorus</hi> was to th' hand and rayne,</l>

               </p>
               <p>The tractableneſſe and love that the Horſe beareth to man, have been the occaſion that ſundry great perſonages have reciprocally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it, by erecting of Statues, and by building of moſt famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their honour and memory. <hi>Alexander</hi> before mentioned, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an opulent City in honour of <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> and gave it his name, and celebrated his exequies. The Egyptians erected moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Piramides, and ſumptuous ſepulchres to ſuch horſes, as had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them well in their warres. <hi>Octavius Caeſar,</hi> and after him, <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, interred their Horſes with great pomp and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and cauſed famous Epitaphs to be engraven upon their monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> did the like to his Horſe <hi>Parſinus,</hi> and commanded that he ſhould be buried in the <hi>Vatican. Romulus</hi> did inſtitute Playes and Games called <hi>Equitiae,</hi> in honour of Horſes, and cauſed them to be preſented in the field of <hi>Mars.</hi> The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> did ſo highly eſteem of theſe noble creatures, as that they armed their Helmets with the skins of Horſes, ſuffering their eares to remain on, and they did weare their tayles upon their Creſts, like as now a daies men uſe their plumes. Other nations have done the like, who held Horſes in no little eſteem. We reade of a Roman Emperour, who made his Horſe a Senator. The ancient Aſtrologers have likewiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed ſo much to Horſes, that they have placed one winged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the coeleſtiall ſignes. The Poets hold that the Fountaine (where the nine Muſes uſed to bath themſelves, and to drink) ſprang up, by the blow of the foot which <hi>Pegaſus</hi> gave againſt the two topt hill, <hi>Parnaſſus. Neptune,</hi> God of the Sea, is ſurnamed <hi>Hippius;</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that (as the Poets doe fable) the firſt Horſe that was ever ſeen, received his origen from him, or from a ſtone whereon <hi>Neptune</hi> had poured water. There remaineth much more to be ſaid in honour of the Horſe, then their hath been already delivered. Wherefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting further Encomiums, and attributes, I haſten to matters of greater conſequence. Sithence therefore the caſe ſo ſtandeth, that this dumb creature is by Almighty God given unto man, as a creature of ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full importance, what thankfulneſſe then are we bound to give unto him for ſo great a bleſſing and benefit? And therefore what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7066:17"/> is required of us; yea, and what carefulneſſe ought we to uſe, in travelling to attaine to this ſo neceſſary a creature in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act manner we are able? Nor can this poſſibly be acquired to our true content, unleſſe we doe apply our beſt endeavours herein; for the Ancients have this Proverb, <hi>All rare and excellent things are hard to compaſſe:</hi> and therefore we ought to apply all care and induſtry to attain unto good Horſes, which can never be ſo well done, as by <hi>breeding</hi> them; for they muſt be the Horſes that will be able beſt to ſerve us in thoſe offices whereunto we ſhall intend them, according as hereafter ſhall be moſt exactly illuſtrated.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the beſt manner of breeding.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are ſo many diverſities of opinions ſo mainly defended <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> that maketh men fearefull to bring that to publique view, which long practice and experience hath brought them to know and underſtand to be moſt true and infallible: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe I preſuming that the more judicious may peradventure favour my reaſons and grounds; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them at leaſt for probable and good, if they ſhall adventure to make triall, which if they be pleaſed ſo to do, I am confident they will both allow and approve of this my manner of <hi>breeding,</hi> above all other wayes heretofore practiſed; who finding it to be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will never be brought from the ſame method, and therefore I would not have any man to condemne me before he ſhall firſt have made triall.</p>
               <p>My counſell therefore is, that ſuch generous ſpirits, unto whom Almighty God hath extended his benigne hand, would take to their conſideration, how needfull a thing it is for them to lay hold upon this ſo noble and profitable a bleſſing and benefit, by applying their beſt care and diligence to breed, good, able, and ſerviceable Horſes, which may be as eaſily performed, and in a manner with as little coſt, as in breeding Iades and Baffles, unuſefull and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For by procuring a good and able Stud of choice Mares, and by endeavouring to get ſelect Stallions, which for mettle, ſpirit, ſhape, colour, marks, and the like, ſhall be known to be rightly bred, and truely generous, as well (I ſay) the Mares as the Stallions; and theſe, young, handſome, of ſize indifferent, that is, neither too ſmall, nor too large, long-legged or under-bodied; but well knit, limb'd, and joynted; it will be beyond all peradventure but that you ſhall have Horſes fit wherewith to ſerve your Country upon all occaſions, and your own turn and your friends, and acquire to your ſelfe no ſmall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7066:17"/> honour and commendations both from your Prince, and the weale publique. And this the better to bee performed, you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that ſome things are neceſſary to be conſidered. Firſt, that your grounds be fit for <hi>breeding,</hi> and thoſe not to be ſuch as be low, wet, fenny, mooriſh, or mariſh; but they muſt be paſtures upland, hilly, and in ſome places ſtony and rocky, for grounds of this nature are very profitable for your Colts, to ſcope, run, and play in, it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth their winde, it knitteth their joynts, and hardeneth and maketh tough their hooves: ſome of your grounds ought alſo not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Underwoods, Buſhes, Furſells, Broome, and the like; theſe will ſerve for ſhelter at what time the cold windes doe blow: the reſidue of your grounds ought to have Lawnes and Plains, wherein ſhould be better graſſe then the former; and in theſe Lawnes, is needfull there ſhould be great Oakes, and ſuch like timber-trees for them whereby to ſhelter them from the ſcorching ſunne in the extreame heats, eſpecially during the time of the Canicular dayes; and theſe trees will alſo defend them from the buzzing and ſtinging Fly, which otherwiſe would greatly annoy and afflict them: you muſt alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate your grounds with partitions convenient, as well for change, which ſometimes is moſt requiſite, as alſo whereby to ſegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate each ſort of cattell by it ſelf; as your young and old, raſe or bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Mares by themſelves, your weanlings by themſelves, your Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes by themſelves, and your ſtoned Colts by themſelves, according as your beſt judgement ſhall dictate; otherwiſe your breed will be in confuſion, and come to nothing, and ſo you may run the hazard, to loſe both your coſt and paines. Places muſt be alſo made apart, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both your Mares with fole, and thoſe who have their Colts ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, may run by themſelves with all quietneſſe and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſſe; and every of theſe partitions muſt be ſo ſufficiently fenced, as that no one ſort of cattell can breake into the other. And I doe yet further adviſe, that theſe grounds be well furniſhed with ſweet and wholeſome water, whereof ought not to be any want, either in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſummer, for otherwiſe you may endanger the tainting and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting of them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that certaine Sheds and Hay-houſes be erected for them to be fed in during the time of the winter, when graſſe is ſcanty and not ſo much nouriſhing, and the cold winds, froſts, raines, and ſnowes, may greatly pinch and annoy them; in which houſings, would be ſet up Rackes and Mangers whereat to feed them; there would alſo be laid cleane ſtraw for them to lye upon, which will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much comfort and keep them warm: But above all, the greateſt care muſt be had to the fences in generall, whether wall (which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore the beſt) pale, quickſets, broad ditches, or high banks, leſt they ſhould at any time breake forth, and treſpaſſe your neighbours to baſtardize, and wrong your breed: and you ought alſo to inſtitute a truſty and diligent Bayliffe or ſervant, whoſe onely function ſhould
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7066:18"/> be to make his fence-walke morning and evening, as duly as any wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Keeper or Wood-man doth his Pale-walke, to ſee that the fences be faſt, and his cattell ſafe: and let him not faile every day once at the leaſt, to take a true tale and inventary of every ſort of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell he hath in his ſeverall grounds, for feare any ſhould be miſſing, or ſome misfortune befalne any of them; and it hee ſhall finde any wanting, let him not reſt ſearching, untill he hath found it; and if it be in danger or ſicke, let him not give over himſelfe if he can, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let him haſte to call company and ſtrength enough) to free it out of harmes way.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the grounds themſelves, as I would not have them too rich, or too rank and deep with graſſe; ſo muſt they not be too barren, ſhort, and moſſie; for as well in this ſubject, as in all other things, the golden meane is evermore to be preferred. Having thus provided your ſelfe of a Stud of the choiceſt and ableſt Mares, for age, colour, ſhape, and marks, your Stallions alſo of like attributes your care muſt be to ſee your Mares well covered, for in this chiefly conſiſteth the life and quinteſſence of your <hi>breeding.</hi> Be you therefore marvellous carefull, that neither your Stallion or Mare, have any of theſe enſuing defects; <hi>viz.</hi> neither Moon-eyes, watry-eyes, or Bloud-ſhotten-eyes, or other defect in their eyes or ſight, no taint in their wind by Glanders or otherwiſe, no way ſubject to Mainge, Mallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Sellender, Splents, Spaven, Curb, Ring-bone, Scratches, Kybed-heeles, or any other the like ſorances; that they be not Cock-throp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but their Throples very looſe; for let either Stallion or Mare have any of theſe maladies, then be you well aſſured their Colts will take them as hereditary from their Parents: inſomuch as when you eſteem your ſelfe confident of ſuch young Horſes, you ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be maſter of, you will be miſtaken; for inſtead of a Stirrier or Horſe for mannage, you have bred him fit for nought elſe but the plough; and in the place of a Hunter, he proves a Mil-horſe; and in hope you had a Horſe for a Courſe, he proves for no better uſe but the Cart; and him you deſire to have for your own Pad-ſaddle, you will be conſtrained to ſell him to a Carrier, to beare a Pack-ſaddle with a burthen.</p>
               <p>To come to intreat of the time moſt fitting for covering your Mares, let that be ſo done, that they may caſt their Foles in the dead of winter; as either in December, or Ianuary: for during their time of going with Fole, to wit, from the day of their Covering, unto that of their Foling, is commonly 12 months, and 10 dayes; yet ſome do aver, they doe want 11 dayes of 12 moneths, of which computation there is juſt three weeks oddes: others againe doe affirme, that a Mare goeth but only 11. months and 10 dayes, wherein is greater oddes: but I have found it to be a moſt certain rule which never did faile me (unleſſe in a yong Mare upon her firſt Colt, who will want ſome few dayes of the ordinary account) and long and frequent experience
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7066:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath made me to be very perfect, that a Mare goeth (unleſſe ſome miſchance or other accident hath otherwiſe occaſioned) twelve mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths and ten dayes: for when at any time I have been preſent when a Mare hath been covered, I have in the very minute entred into my Almanacke, the very day and houre in which ſhe tooke the Horſe; and becauſe I would not be deceived, I have been preſent at her fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and I have found the time never to faile me. And therefore I could wiſh all <hi>breeders</hi> to obſerve with me the ſame courſe, and they ſhall finde this account to fall out juſt as I have delivered. If your Mare be covered about S. <hi>Lucies</hi> day, which is the 13 of December, then will ſhe fole about S. <hi>Thomas</hi> day the ſame month in the yeare following: But before you ſuffer her to be covered, let neither the Stallion or Mare be at graſſe, but taken into the houſe, ſixe weekes or a moneth at the leaſt; during which time, let them be both very well fed with good old Hay and Oates well duſted and ſifted, to the end they may have ſtrength and ſeed to performe the office for which you have them. But if you will have your Mare certainly to conceive, then take bloud from both ſides of her necke, and let her bleed at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veine well nigh a quart; which muſt be done five or ſixe dayes before ſhe is to be covered; and the next day after her bleeding, give her in a quart of new milke, halfe a iij. of Artimeſia, <hi>alias</hi> Mugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, chopped very ſmall, a piece of ſweet Butter, and ℥ 2. of <hi>London</hi> Treacle warm; all theſe put upon the fire till the Butter and Treacle be diſſolved, and give this to the Mare bloud-warme in the morning faſting, and ſo the next morning again, and let her drinke be white water. This drink is moſt ſoveraigne to cauſe conception, it provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſeed abundantly, it openeth the pores in the body, and cauſeth the Mare to keep the ſeed ſhe receiveth from the Stallion; Moreover this drinke comforteth the womb and matrix very much: ſo as it is great oddes but that ſhe being thus ordered, will be ſped and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, unleſſe ſhe be a Mare of great ſterility, which ſuppoſed, ſhe is not to be kept for a race or breeding Mare.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if you be deſirous to have your Mare to conceive a Horſe-colt, rather then a Filly; obſerve then this leſſon I ſhall here give you, and you ſhall finde it an infallible rule, which will never miſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> At what time you would have your Mare to be covered, Let it be done, when one of the firſt five maſculine Signes do raign, which are either <hi>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,</hi> or <hi>Leo;</hi> but if ſhe ſhall be covered when any of the Feminine or watery Signes are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, as <hi>Virgo, Libra Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius,</hi> or <hi>Piſces;</hi> then be you confident it will be a Filly. For this have I often tryed, and found it ſeldome or never to faile me, eſpecially if the wind be either Weſt or North (but Weſt is beſt) at the time of her covering, and you will finde this my rule to be moſt infallible, for experience hath taught it me: And <hi>I have attained unto more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by experience, then I was ever able to aſpire unto, either by reading
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7066:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſtudy, or by hearing what others have dictated, taught, or told mee:</hi> For we have a maxime, <hi>Experience is the beſt and ableſt miſtreſſe and moderatrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the manner of the covering of your Mares, let her be brought into ſome place abroad, and there faſtned to ſome ſtrong poſt; then bring out to her ſome ſtoned Iade firſt to dally with her, and he will provoke her to an aptitude and deſire of coity; which done, let the Stallion be led forth towards her, betwixt two or more luſty ſtrong men who may be able to maſter him if he ſhould prove unruly, and let him leap her; and let this be done in a morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times faſting; which done, another man ſtanding by with a paile of cold water ready in his hand, in the very time when the Horſe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting, let him caſt the cold water upon her ſhape; which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the coldneſſe, the ſtrength of the caſter, and the ſuddenneſſe thereof, will cauſe her to ſhrinke in, and truſſe up her body, and it will be the meanes to make her retaine the ſeed in the matrix, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the womb would not peradventure ſo ſoone encloſe it, but for ſome time after, howſoever the womb would draw together, but not ſo ſuddenly, whereby upon the Mares motion, there might be ſome danger of diſſolving. Take then away the Stallion, and let the Mare be put into ſome remote place alone, from ſight and hearing of other Horſes and Mares, but let her neither eate nor drinke in foure hours after, neither let her have any water at all till night, and then give her either a ſweet Maſh, or white water. After ſhe hath been thus Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you ſhall know whether or not ſhe hath either conceived, or loſt, or caſt her ſeed, by many evident ſymptomes which will appeare to your eye; for if ſhe retaineth a good ſtomacke to her meat, and ſo continueth, if ſhe doe not neigh at hearing or ſight of other horſes, if ſhe do not piſſe oft times in the day, caſteth not her eye about gazing continually at every noiſe ſhe heareth, pricketh not up her eares, and that in three or foure daies after her Covering, her belly ſeemeth to be more gaunt, her hayre more ſlicke and cloſe to her skin, ſhewing of a brighter colour, and ſhe ſeemeth to fall away and become leane: if (I ſay) any of theſe Symptomes doe appeare in her, then is it an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident ſigne ſhe hath kept her ſeed and conceiveth, but if the contrary appeare in her, then hath ſhe loſt it, and engendreth not.</p>
               <p>But as for offering her the Horſe againe ten dayes after, together with ſuch like circumſtances, I hold them impertinent for this place, being ſo frequently knowne and practiſed, and therefore my labour may well be ſpared. But for her keeping and ordring after her Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, let her not drinke that ſhe deſireth, but continue her with the ſame dyet which formerly ſhe had before her covering for three weeks or a month after, leſt the ſeed might fortune to be impaired, before the Colt be ſufficiently formed in the womb, and let her be kept ſweet and cleane as may be, and that without any labour or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe during that three weeks or moneth: after which terme you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7066:19"/> may if you pleaſe, inure her to moderate labour, wherein have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of foure things: firſt, that ſhe be not at any time gallopped, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or run off from her wind: ſecondly, that ſhe be not put to carry hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> burthens: thirdly, that ſhe be neither laboured or travelled in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heat: And laſtly, that her exerciſe be not ſuch which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> her to ſweat violently, for every of theſe things will cauſe her to miſcarry.</p>
               <p>Shee being thus with fole: ſhee muſt bee kept in the houſe untill mid-May at leaſt, and then let firſt her ſhooes be taken off, her feet pared well, the Fruſh and heeles opened, and plates after the manner of running ſhooes (but not to come home to the heeles) ſet on; let her run in the drieſt ground you have, yet not ſo ſhort of graſſe, but that ſhe may at her eaſe fill her belly at leaſt once a day, and about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of September, (if not before) let her be very carefully taken into the houſe, but ſo quietly that you ſhall not endanger the hurting of her belly, either by the ruſhing of other Horſes and Mares againſt her, or through her unruly leaping, or inconſiderate bruſhing againſt poſts, dores, or the like. Let her be kept thus in the houſe to the time of her foling, and long after, and let her dyet be as before is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p>And when the time of her foling approacheth, let her keeper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend carefully upon her, putting her into a houſe convenient for her, unhaltred and untied, leſt in foling, the colt receive domage, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Mares doe commonly caſt their foles ſtanding: wherefore let not the roome whereinto you put her, be too ſtreight, but very warme, (for warmth is a great comfort as well to Mares with fole, as in foling) and let good ſtore of ſtraw be layed, that the Fole may fall from the Mare the ſofter, and be in leſſe danger of harm, and let her (I ſay) be watched for feare the Fole come not right; and ſo ſoone as ſhe hath foled and licked it dry, let her keeper preſently milke and ſtroake her, and that before the Colt doe ſucke her, which will both cauſe her to give down her milke, making the ſame to multiply, and alſo keep the Vdder that the milke doe not clod, which if it ſhould doe, the Mare might happily in ſhort time become dry, whereof if there be any perill, I then adviſe you to draw as much milke from her as you can; and boyle it with the leaves of Lavender, or Spike, and ſo bathe her Vdder therwith warme, continuing ſo daily to doe, untill by this meanes you have broken the curd, knobs, and knots, cauſing them to be diſſolved. And as for the water which ſhe is to drinke for ſome time after her foling, let it be either ſweet Maſhes, or white water, &amp; a moneth after her foling, give her a Maſh, putting thereinto the powder of Brimſtone, or Savin, or the like, which will be a great preſervation of the Colt; &amp; then if ſhe be moderately laboured either at Plough or Harrow, if ſhe will draw, as well the Mare as Colt will proſper the better; provided ſhe be kept from raw meat while ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the Stable, by which meanes ſhe will the ſooner recover
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7066:20"/> ſtrength, luſt, and courage, and have ſtore of good milke, which will cauſe the Colt to thrive the better, and to grow to be of the greater bone, which above all things is a matter of greateſt conſequence. And that you ſuffer not the Colt to ſucke the Mare when ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from worke, untill ſhe be throughly cold, leſt thereby you ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet the Colt.</p>
               <p>Thus much I have thought fit to handle of this ſubject; and albeit I have laboured herein to attaine to brevity, nevertheleſſe the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes well conſidered, I ſhall not greatly offend in prolixity, howſoever this my manner of <hi>breeding</hi> being different from the old received cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, will not (I doe aſſure me) paſſe voyd of cenſure. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old cuſtomes, thus much I doe averre, that as they are in many caſes of that force, as no law is able to abrogate; ſo on the contrary part, many of them are ſo abſurd and ridiculous, as nothing can be more; for what ſaith the civill Law? <hi>Thoſe things which by event or ſucceſſe of time are found to be pernicious or hurtfull, even theſe things ought to be repealed, yea albeit they were at the firſt found profitable.</hi> Which ground holdeth good in nothing ſo much as in old cuſtomes, for of their abſurdities, I am able to produce inſtances not a few, howſoever with many, <hi>It is one of</hi> Hercules <hi>greateſt labours to beat many a man from his old cuſtomes be they never ſo bad,</hi> albeit <hi>Cuſtome is a meere tyrant, and his ſoveraignty moſt inſufferable,</hi> as a grave Author very well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving thus waded into this myſtery of <hi>breeding,</hi> I hold it a thing very behoovefull to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, how your Stable ought to be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Firſt therefore your Stable ſhould be ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate where the ayre is wholeſome, pure, and good, and the ground dry: the ſtructure would be either of free Stone or Bricke, but Bricke is beſt, moſt wholeſome and warmeſt: beſides this benefit Brick hath, which Stone hath not, of being very dry, for Stone will weep, and ſweat drops of water againſt raine and miſty weather, which begetteth damps, and cauſeth rhumes in Horſes. Your Stable ought not to have any unſavory Gutter, Channell, or Sinke neare to it; no Iakes, Hogſties, or Hen-rouſt, whereby to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy it. It would be alſo ſeeled over head, and have ſtrong doores, with lockes, bolts, and barres unto it. The Racke would not be made too high, or too low, but placed in an indifferent proportion, and ſo artificially ſet, that neither the duſt or hay-ſeeds may fall into his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7066:20"/> Mane, or upon his necke and face. The Manger would be ſet at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different height, made deep, and of one entire piece, as well for ſtrength, as for conveniency to be kept ſweet and cleane. Let the flore be pitched with Flint, and not planked. The windowes would be made with handſome ſhuts and caſements, and well glazed, as well to keep out cold and wind, as alſo (when there may be cauſe) to let in the coole and freſh ayre. Againe, take heed there be no lome wall or plaiſter, ſo neare as that the Horſe may reach thereto with bis mouth: for upon that he will gnaw, which may doe him much prejudice, and be the cauſe of much dangerous ſickneſſe, for Lome and Lime are ſuffocating things, they will infect and putrifie the bloud, endanger the Lounges, and be no friend to his winde: neither ſuffer any dung to lye neare him. Furthermore there would be made a faire Loft wherein to lay Hay, and convenient lodging chambers for your Groomes, whoſe neareneſſe, together with their care and vigilancy might prevent many dangers and inconveniences which may accrue unto your Horſes by night. Alſo let a neat Saddle-houſe be contrived with Bings for Provender, and in it Preſſes, wherein to lay up the Saddles, Bridles, and all other furniture appertaining to Horfes, and an Aqua-duct wherewith to bring water to the Stable. And laſtly, other Stals would be erected remote, wherein upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſever the ſicke from the ſound. Many other accoutrements there are belonging to a perfect Stable, as partitions with boards, poſts, and barres, with pins driven into every poſt, whereon to hang Bridles and the like; ſhelves alſo faſtned to the wall ſerving for many uſes, to place neceſſaries upon, &amp;c. which being known to all men, will be needleſſe for me here to repeate.</p>
               <p>But you may peradventure ſtartle at paving, rather then planking your flore, preferring planks as warmer, and much better then flint or a pitched flore can be; as alſo for that it is a new thing, little pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, and ſeldome heard.</p>
               <p>But give me leave (I pray) a little to inform your underſtanding in this one point, by which means your judgement may fortune to be much bettered. Firſt therefore, whereas novelty may be objected, I ſhall moſt eaſily aſſoile that point, even from the ſelfe-ſame ground in the civill Law, which I inſerted in the concluſion of the precedent chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That things found to be prejudiciall, ought to be inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, although they might be thought needfull, and good in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known times. For that paving of Stables is better then planking them,<note place="margin">Paving Stab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</note> I have reaſons not a few wherewith to ſatisfie a reaſonable man. Firſt, it is much more durable and laſting, ſuppoſing the flore to be pitched by an expert workman: Secondly, it is leſſe charge by much, and therefore in that point the better: Thirdly, for a Horſe to ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon a pitched flore, it emboldneth his feet, and treading the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> more: Fourthly, it is the moſt excellent thing that may be for Colts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who are unſhod; for it hardneth their hooves, ſo as by cuſtome they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:7066:21"/> will be as bold to goe upon ſtones, rocky and hard wayes, as Horſes that are ſhod: neither will a pitched flore ſuffer the hoofe to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in manner of an Oyſter: beſides the uſe thereof will make their hooves more tough, durable, and hollow, inſomuch as when they ſhall come to be ſhod, and to have exerciſe, they will carry their ſhooes much longer, better, and with more eaſe then otherwiſe, if they had been uſed to a planked flore.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of a planked flore.</note>Now on the contrary part, which concerneth the planked flore, that (I ſay) cannot in reaſon be ſo good by many degrees. Firſt, it is more ſlippery, out of which reaſon a mettled horſe may ſoone be in danger to be lamed or ſpoyled by ſome ſudden ſlip, whereof I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> had often experience, which a pitched Stable is not ſo ſubject unto: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the planks often times ſhrinking, the Horſe (eſpecially if he be a ſtirrier who is accuſtomed to curvet in the Stable) may eaſily breake a plank, and his foot getting into a hole, or between the planks, the horſe plunging and ſtriving, may eaſily breake his legge before he ſhall be able to get it forth, whereof I have more than once <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> been <hi>oculatus teſtis:</hi> Thirdly, when you put forth your horſes to run at graſſe all, or the moſt part of Summer, during which time the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heats wil ſo ſiccicate and dry the planks, which will cauſe them to warp, and the pinnes which holdeth them down to the joyces will rot, and ſo the planks give way, eſpecially when horſes (who not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing handled in ſome moneths before) becomming wild, rammage, and unruly, are newly brought into the Stable, who feeling the planks to move, yeeld, and give way under them, will fall from ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereat, to ſlinging, leaping, bounding and plunging, till they have diſlocated the planks, and thereby have endangered both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the reſidue of their fellowes, and thoſe who might come to their help and ſuccour, which is a thing very frequent in a flore of this nature: Fourthly, whereas you may imagine that a planked flore is warmer then a paved or pitched, I doe know the contrary; for your pitched flore hath no vaults or channels under them, like as hath your planked, wherewith to convey the water which paſſeth from the horſes; hy which meanes the horſe lyeth over a moyſt and dampiſh place and vault; and beſides that, the evill ſavour of the horſe-piſſe will be evermore in their noſe, which is moſt unwholeſome, noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and many times the cauſe of much infirmity; neither can it in reaſon be ſo warme as is the pitched flore, for that the chinkes and awger-holes bored through the planks (which muſt alwaies be kept open to let forth the urine) doth give way to the cold wind, which continually aſcendeth up to the horſe, as well lying as ſtanding, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but doe him much dammage. I doe therefore affirme, that if your Groome have a care to litter his horſe well, ſo as he may lye ſoft and warme, (which is a prime property appertaining to his office) your horſe will then proſper, and like much better upon a pitched flore, then he can upon a planked; provided your flore be laid even, not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7066:21"/> higher before than behind, more then ſo much that may make the water to avoyd to his hinder feet, where there ought to be a ſmall gutter to cauſe it to paſſe away, for in raiſing your flore ſo much, I doe abſtract from the ancient ill cuſtome, by reaſon that a horſe ſtandeth higher before then he doth behind, his hinder legges will ſwell, and ſo he becommeth lame; beſides; it giveth him a taint in the backe and kidneyes; and to conclude, his long ſtanding in this uneaſie manner, begetteth in the poor beaſt much pain and griefe, and this occaſioneth unto him (which would not otherwiſe be) the putting forth of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, Pains, Scratches, and ſuch like noyſome ſorances.</p>
               <p>Another thing may peradventure be thought ſtrange, which I have handled in the former chapter, where I intreat of <hi>breeding;</hi>

Moreover, the Colt beſides the milke he draweth from the Mare, will alſo feed with her upon Hay, Oates, Bran, and ſuch like food, which will do him much pleaſure: But ſome againe will ſay, that their teeth are ſo tender, as that they will not be able to chew and eate ſuch kinde of hard meates; I anſwer, they are very much miſtaken, for, not onely my ſelfe alone, but ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have with me been eye-witneſſes of the contrary; therefore this needs no further ſolution. And wheras it hath been objected unto me, that that Colt which is foled in May, or <hi>Solſtice,</hi> in that ſeaſon,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7066:22"/> the Mare will have ſtore of milke, thus much I doe ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, but then what manner of milke will it be? None other then ſuch as ſhall be marvellous thin and watriſh, (as I ſaid before) which abundance will alſo faile, even when the Colt hath moſt need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that is, when the Colt beginneth to come up to ſome ſtrength, and at what time he ſhould receive moſt nutriment, to wit, when the winter commeth on, whoſe Snows, Froſts, cold raines, and Flouds; will not a little nip and pinch the Colt, and enfeeble the Mare in ſuch terrible and deſperate manner, that ſhe will want her former plenty of food, warme and dry lodging, and other neceſſary reliefe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation, and ſo in like manner, her abundance of milke, at what time her poore Colt ſhould depend upon the enfeebled Mare, who is not able to ſupply its own need: by meanes whereof it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall out, that ſhe muſt bring both her ſelfe and her Colt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame poverty, not being able to ſuſtaine her own life, much leſſe her Colts and her own, and ſo become feeble before winter be halfe ſpent; and over and above all this, the Colt will by his running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with the Mare, become ſo ſalvage and wilde, as that if any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity ſhould happen to ſeize upon it, its own unrulineſſe will be ſo great, that the cure may thereby become the more difficile: for to ſpeake truely, infinite have been, and daily are the numbers of Colts; yea, and thoſe many times rightly bred, which have miſcarried and periſhed in this nature.</p>
               <p>I doe therefore conclude, and as a friend to my Country averre, that the ableſt way to breed up the beſt and moſt ſerviceable Horſes, is (as I have before inculcated) after this methode and none other; and therefore I am bold to adviſe all noble Gentlemen who are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of good Horſes, and of this myſtery, to make triall, and to put theſe my rudiments in execution, and he will never (I doe well aſſure me) hereafter, either alter or ſwerve from them; for of this kinde of <hi>breeding,</hi> I have had more then forty yeares good experience: during which time, I intimated theſe my grounds to a Knight, an intimate friend of mine, who was a great lover of good Horſes, and as great a Breeder, as a lover of them, and very well verſed in Horſe-man-ſhip, who hearing my reaſons, and throughly digeſting them, approved of them ſo well, as that he fell to follow theſe my inſtructions, and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them ſufficient, would never be brought from them after; he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, no way comparable to this: for he found by plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that whereas in former times in breeding (as commonly he did, ten or twelve Colts yearly; when they came to Backing, Riding, and proofe of thoſe ten or twelve, he thought himſelfe well appay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his labour and coſt well beſtowed, if two or three at the moſt proved right, and to his minde; whereas ever after in ten Colts thus bred and reared up, hardly any one miſſed, which proved not right and to his good liking: and this manner of <hi>breeding,</hi> made him more in love with this myſtery, then ever before, reaſon dictating it ſo well
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7066:22"/> unto him. For, moſt certain it is, when the Stallion and Mare are both right, and have all their true attributes, and the time, ſeaſon, and manner of <hi>breeding,</hi> with all circumſtances thereunto belonging, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and in every point duly obſerved; it will be a hard matter for the Colt to prove ill: but if otherwiſe, then marvell not if the Colt anſwer not your expectation, according to the Greeke Adage, which ſaith; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next thing befitting our ſubject, is to ſpeake (albeit briefly) of the Colours, Marks, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Shapes of Horſes: Wherein I will firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other mens opinions, and laſtly, mine owne. Some there be who hold that Colours, Marks, and Shapes are little materiall to make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Horſe, which I will not contradict, for my meaning is not to traduce or controule any man: but this I will ſay, that if a good horſe have theſe properties adherent to his goodneſſe, then is he queſtionleſſe in much better eſteem, for if beauty be added to his other inward vertues, then is he (like to the Nightingale in the beginning of Aprill, heard and hearkened unto, more praiſe-worthy, and better prized. For a horſe, who if he be good and ſerviceable, well metled, bold, and hardy, of a gentle condition, of a round and comely trot and pace, lightly and well borne, obedient mouthed, ſure on foot, tough, ſtrong, and eaſie; will (I ſay) not ſuch a horſe be well eſteemed? But if together with theſe good properties, there ſhall be added, good colour, true marks, and perfect ſhape, which cauſeth him to appeare moſt beautifull to all beholders: will not theſe endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſet him the better forth? and cauſe him to be the better eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7066:23"/> of every man deſired, and much more money offered for him? nay, ſhall not you (whoſe the horſe is) be come unto, be ſued unto, have letters ſent you from ſundry friends, and will not your ſelfe prize him at a higher rate than otherwiſe you would have done? yes aſſuredly; and hereof I make no queſtion. True it is, and I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe no leſſe, that a horſe may be very good, and performe his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction very well, who hath neither good colour, true marks, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhape; nevertheleſſe theſe extrinſecall vertues are more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found, and better obſerved to be in good horſes, in whom are colour, markes, and ſhape; than in horſes which are otherwiſe. Wherefore becauſe theſe things are termed exteriour vertues, and therefore takes its object from the eye onely, I will conjoyne them altogether in this my diſcourſe, and ſhew you what hath been, and is, the opinion of both ancient and moderne Writers. <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gickes, handling moſt accurately ſundry points of husbandry, among other things in his third book of Georgicks, deſcribeth the horſe, as well his breeding, and his ſeverall ſorts of imployments, as his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſhape, and markes; yea, and that in moſt exquiſite manner: And thus he beginneth:

He alſo ſheweth ſignes whereby to know the good or evill ſight of a horſe.<note place="margin">How to know the good light from the bad of a horſe.</note> Every horſe (ſaith he) hath a feather in his Face betwixt his eyes: if the ſaid feather be high above the eyes, then hath he aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a good and perfect ſight; but if the feather be below his eyes, the horſe then hath oft times a bad ſight: Obſerve this rule well, and you ſhall finde it to be a thing moſt certaine. He alſo giveth other marks touching the Legges of a horſe: which briefly are, that a horſe muſt have his fore-legs above the knees, to be ſtrong, flat, and large, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the lower part of the Legges be ſmall: provided he have a good foot, which ſuppoſing, he may prove a horſe of long continuance. Another Author ſpeaking of the colours of Horſes,<note place="margin">Which be the beſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of a Horſe.</note> doth denominate them after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> A Brown-Bay, a Black-Roan, or Black full of ſilver hayres Cole-black, Cheſt nut, Dark-Bay, Fly-bitten, or White-Lyard. The Browne-Bay is ſo highly eſteemed with all Nations, as that they doe with one aſſent alwaies ranke him in the very firſt place of colours: the Italians and French doe ſo much prize the Brown-Bay, as that they evermore call that colour <hi>Bayary Loyall,</hi> the Loyall Bayard, or more properly according to our Engliſh

The French, Italians, and Germans doe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far commend and prefer three ſorts of colours in Horſes: to wit, the Browne-Bay, the Cheſt-nut, and the Cole-Black; but they doe evermore preferre the Browne-Bay to the firſt place.

This indeede is of all true Horſe-men eſteemed a moſt beautifull good Marke, and well becometh a good Horſe. Some would have the foote being white, to be on the farre foote behinde, and ſome again on the neare foote before: I have heard ſome highly commend the Horſe to have two white feete a croſſe, to wit, the far-foote behind, and the neere foot before, like as had a Horſe of the old Lord <hi>Sandes,</hi> being a Courſer, which he brought out of <hi>Italy,</hi> with ſo much charge, labour, and perill of his life, (as his Lordſhip did ſundry times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port unto me,) which was of a darke Bay, and his two feete a croſſe white, howſoever I have known ſome Horſemen, diſlike of the ſame Markes, yet I could never heare the reaſons of their diſlike. A Knight of my acquaintance would highly commend the Horſe, who had a white foote, which was beſpeckled with blacke motly ſpots; affirming that a Horſe ſo marked did betoken good mettle, great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and a heroick ſpirit, for he would alwaies call ſuch a Horſe, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus generoſus,</hi> a Horſe of a brave ſpirit; and this hee would report, was taught him by old Sir <hi>Henry Lea,</hi> that famous Horſe-man, and no leſſe excellent Breeder, of whom this Knight bought many deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Colts, ſome of which were thus marked. All good Horſemen doe atteſt, that the Horſe with much white upon his face, raw noſed, ſheath, yard, tuell, &amp; hooves white, skin white, and legs hoſed, &amp; wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed; is generally weake, faint, of a cowardly condition, tender, and waſhy of fleſh, ſubject to rebellion, reſtifenes, to ſtarting, ſtumbling, evill-ſighted, ſubject to tire, dangerous to his Keeper, for biting and ſtriking; and in a word, of a moſt baſe, and evill condition.

               <p>Now as touching the perfect and true ſhape of a Horſe, wherein we have more contrariety of opinions, than are either in the Colour or Marks, whereof I have given you a taſt already: Nevertheleſſe, I will demonſtrate how farre commonly all doe meete in the ſhape of a well timbred Horſe.<note place="margin">The perfect ſhape of a Horſe.</note> Firſt therefore it is required that the hoofe be blacke, ſmooth, dry, large, round, and hollow: the Paſterns ſtraight, and upright, Fetlocks ſhort, the legges ſtraight, and flat, called alſo lath-legged, the knees bony, leane and round, the necke long, high-rear'd, and great towards the Breaſt, the Breaſt large and round, the Eares ſmall, ſharpe, long, and upright, the Forehead leane, and large, the Eyes great, full, and black, the Browes well filled and ſhooting outwards, the Iawes wide, ſlender, and leane, the Noſthrills wide, and open, the Mouth great, the Head long, and leane like to a Sheepe, the Mane thin and large, the Withers ſharp and pointed, the Back ſhort, even, plaine, and double chined, the Sides, and Ribbes deepe, large, and bearing out like the cover of a Trunke, and cloſe ſhut at the huckle-bone, the Belly long, and great, but hid under the ribs, the Flanks full, yet gaunt, the Rump round, plaine, and broad, with a large ſpace betwixt the Buttocks, the Thighs long, and large, with wel-faſhioned bones, and thoſe fleſhy, the Hams dry, and ſtreight, the Trunchion ſmall, long, well ſet on, &amp; well couched, the Trayne long, not too thick, and falling to the ground, the Yard, and Stones ſmall; and laſtly the Horſe to be well riſen before. And to conclude, the perfect ſhape of a Horſe, according as a famous Horſeman hath deſcribed, is in a few words, thus; <hi>Viz.</hi> A broad Forehead, a great Eye, a leane Head, thin, ſlender, leane, wide Iawes; a long, high-rear'd Neck, high-rear'd Withers; a broad, deepe Cheſt, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; upright Paſterns, and a narrow Hoofe: And this is the common allowed, and approved ſhape of a perfect Horſe; ſo as if any of theſe things be deficient in him, he cannot be ſaid to be a Horſe of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Shape: Wherefore I conclude that if a Horſe of a good Colour, well Marked, and rightly Shaped, and right alſo by Syre, and Mare; it will be ſeldome ſeene that he ſhould prove ill, unleſſe his Nature be alienated, and marred, either in the Backing and Riding, or elſe that he be otherwiſe wronged, and moſt ſhamefully abuſed by the means of a hare-brain, negligent, or inconſiderate Rider or Groome. But I may in this point bee taxed to hold a Paradox; for ſome may object unto me, that many times Horſes, who are of the beſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, beſt Marks, and trueſt Shapes, doe nevertheleſſe prove arrant jades, reſtiffe, ſtubborn, ill natured, ſubject to tyring, and the like: I anſwere, I acknowledge all this to be moſt true, for I have knowne
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7066:28"/> Horſes, who upon their firſt view, have beene in extrinſecall ſhew ſo hopefull, as that they have promiſed what a man could expect from them; which notwithſtanding when they have come to the teſt, they have beene a ſcandall to their ſex; but this is not a thing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, for in every one of theſe who have thus miſcarryed; you ſhall have twenty who will prove right, and anſwerable to your minde: I have alſo knowne Horſes, which wanting theſe good attributes, and who have beene as different from thoſe we call good, even as Chalk is from Cheeſe, who have proved very good Horſes: howbeit I will not counſell you to breed upon ſuch an one, who albeit hee may bring you Colts, yet I dare not promiſe you he ſhall ever bring you a good Colt, whereof I have oftimes made tryall, as well for Horſes of Mennage, as for Hunters, and Horſes for the Courſe.

Others there are, who being ſo active and dexterous, as to be able to ſit a rough unridden Colt, a few plunges, by faſt holding with both hands to the Mane and Pummell, and by clinging with their legges cloſe to the body of the horſe, till by ſtriving and his violent diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red agitation, he hath put himſelfe from off his winde; he will not ſticke preſently to promiſe to himſelfe, the true and entire myſtery of able Horſemanſhip. Others againe I oft meet with, who by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times frequenting the Muze, and other places, where Riders uſe to menage; who after have made no bones to cry themſelves up for as good &amp; as able Horſemen, as any in <hi>England.</hi> Others I doe very well know, who by reading, have made ſome petty practiſe howſoever

Secondly, let him be taken up from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> graſſe about the feaſt of Saint <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> which is upon the 24. day of Auguſt, or ſoon after, for then the ſeaſon doth begin to let fall cold dewes, which betideth no good, but much harme to your horſe, and then beginneth the heart of graſſe to faile, ſo as the graſſe which then he ſeedeth upon, breedeth no good nutriment, but groſſe fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke and cold humours, which putrifieth and corrupteth the bloud. Let your horſe (I ſay) be taken up about the day before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7066:31"/> but with all the quietnes may be, for feare of heating him, by reaſon his greaſe he gat at graſſe is tender, ſo as every little motion will diſſolve the ſame, whereby the bloud may be inflamed, and ſo the Horſe be brought into eminent perill at leaſt of ſickneſſe, if not of death. A day or two after you have him in the Stable, or ſooner, let him be ſhod, and let bloud, and drencht, as before is ſhewed you; for this preventeth Yellowes, Stavers; and ſuch like diſeaſes, which the Gaule, and Spleen occaſioneth, which the heart and ſtrength of graſſe (through the ranknes of the bloud) doth ingender in his body; Then purg and cleanſe him both outwardly and inwardly, like as you are taught in lib. 2. chapter 2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſearch your Horſes mouth, both then and at other times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> often, for feare of Barbes, Bigs, Bliſters, and Cankers, and ſuch like maladies which are very incident to breed in the mouths of Horſes, which by the colour of the ſpots of his Gums, Tongue, and Mouth you may perceive, and ſo the better and more eaſily both prevent, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and cure all ſuch diſeaſes as are inherent to thoſe parts. Fourthly, rub and waſh ſometimes your Horſes mouth, and tongue with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Verjuce mingled with bay ſalt, but Verjuce is the better, and let ſome paſſe downe his throat, for it is both wholeſome and good. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, obſerve your Horſes Eyes, and Countenance, which if you doe find them to be heavy, drowſie, and dull, then be you confident all is not well within him: Then take bloud from him, and give him the drinke of <hi>Diapente,</hi> or <hi>Diateſseron,</hi> and hee ſhall doe well againe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, obſerve well his ſtanding, and his going, if you doe perceive him to felter with any of his feet be it never ſo little, or elſe which foote ſoever he doth favour, let the Groome preſently take up that foot, and examine it, if he can feele any place warmer than other, let him now aſſure himſelf ſomething is amiſſe there, take off the Shoo, and ſearch the foot carefully, to ſee whether gravell, or naile be any cauſe thereof; but if you doe find all well there, ſearch the heele and fruſh, if you find not any thing there, ſearch higher for ſome ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that may be in the paſtern-joynt in the legge, or backe ſinew; and when he hath found the fault, and cauſe of his complaint, let him preſently informe the Ferrier, who is to apply his remedies, and by this meanes he ſhall diſcharge his duty as well becometh him.

Eightly, when you are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> to take your journey with him, water him in the Houſe, and give him his break-faſt of good cleane Oates, ſweet, and wel-ſifted; then bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle him and tie him up to the Rack, then curry, dreſſe, and ſaddle him, but draw not the girts too ſtreight till you come to take his back; then preſently caſt his cloath over him leaſt he take cold, and when you come to take his back, draw his girts ſtreight, and ſo on God's
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7066:31"/> name begin your journey, but for a mile, two, or more, goe faire and ſoftly, for if you heat him too ſoone, he will not digeſt his meate, but crudityes will ariſe in his ſtomacke, which you ſhall perceive by his ſcouring &amp; purging, as he travaileth, whereby you may either foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in his body, or elſe cauſe a <hi>Calientura,</hi> burning Fever, or ſome other worſe infirmity to ſeize him: and as you doe travell him, when you are come ſome foure or five miles from home, a light from him, and walke him, ſometimes ſtanding ſtill to ſee if you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to ſtale, for it is very wholeſome and good, which you may alſo doe well to attempt when you diſmount and walke him down any hill: and ſome three miles before you come to your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies end, Ride him into ſome River or other watering place, unto his belly, but no deeper in any wiſe, and then let him drinke, yet not ſo much at the firſt, as he deſireth, but by degrees, firſt taking up his head to cauſe him to waſh his mouth, whereby to free it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> filth &amp; fome; Then let him drinke halfe his draught, and laſtly, ſo much as in reaſon he will: Then obſerve upon what pace you brought him to the water, with the ſame pace, (and neither ſoftlier nor faſter) Ride him a mile or better, by which time he will have warmed the water in his belly, without taking cold or harme. This watering him thus, will very much refreſh him, cauſe him to forget his weariſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and when he ſhall come to eate, it will be with very good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, which otherwiſe he would not have done. A mile at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you come to your journies end, ſlack your pace, and begin to go more ſoftly, to the end he may not be too hot when he ſhalbe ſet up, have him without delay into the Stable warme, well littered up to the belly; but take heed you ſuffer him not to be either walked, or waſhed, for theſe two things are very pernitious, and moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for him, and the cauſe of more ſickneſſe, ſorances, and death to Horſes, then of all other things beſides. So ſoone as you have brought him into the Stable, the firſt thing you doe, off with your Coate, and tie him up to the empty Rack; then litter him up to the belly, ungird him, take off his Saddle, rub his back with ſpeed, and put his cloath upon him, and upon that his Saddle againe, and gird him with his Surſingle, then make cleane his ſtirrops, ſtirrop-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Girts, and rubbe him downe, both Legges, Belly, Body, Breaſt, Head, Face, and Neck, and ſo ſtuffe him up with cleane dry ſtraw, and let him ſtand ſo upon the Bit an houre, evermore looking upon him leaſt he ſweat a new, which if you ſhall perceive, then to alay it, take away ſome of the ſtraw wherewith he is ſtuffed, and hee will coole againe; if you finde him in good temper, unbridle him, and waſh his mouth with water and ſalt, and waſh alſo his Bit, and ſo bridle him up againe, and give him ſome good Hay in his Rack to champ upon, for halfe an houres ſpace. After come to him againe, and then unbridle him, put on his Coller-halter, and ſo give him freſh Hay to eate: Then rub him all over, and ſo let him ſtand till
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7066:32"/> you have ſupped; then come to him, and give him either a ſweete maſh or white water, which when he hath drunke, let him eate Hay for halfe an houre after, and then give him his Provender, but by degrees, not too much together, for feare of cloying him, which ſo ſoone as he hath diſpatched, unſaddle him, and rub his body all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, cloath him up warme, and whiſp him up round with ſmall whiſps: Which done, rub his legges dry, picke, and ſtop his feete, and annoint the Coffins and Cronets of his Hoofes, giving hin Hay for all night: and laſtly ſhake up his litter about and under him, that ſo he may ly ſoft, and warme: and thus doing, leave him to his reſt.</p>
               <p>The next morning, come to him early; and firſt obſerve whether or not he hath layne downe; then looke upon his Ordure, whether it be laxative or coſtive, or if he hath avoyded any greaſe, which if he hath, give him with his Oates, a handfull or two of Hemp-ſeed, and ſo order him as you are accuſtomed, or otherwiſe as you in diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe find to be moſt requiſite. Many other rudiments there are to be given, which for that they are ſo commonly knowne to every Groome, are impertinent to rehearſe: Only in a word for a cloſe, I ſay, that a good Groome ought to be a man of good life, and ſober demeanour, no Tipler, no haunter of Ale-houſes, or Tavernes, (like as too too many are) no lyer abroad from his Horſe in the night, nor long from him in the day, and an early riſer; the Stable muſt be his Compting-houſe; he muſt not be ſo intimate with any as with his Horſe; have entercourſe with none ſo much as with him he muſt be his principall aſſociate, and make him of his Cabbinet-councell: his Horſe muſt be his only <hi>Idaea,</hi> the only Miſtreſſe whom he muſt court, and ſerve: and ſo ſoone as he doth ſuſpect but any the leaſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in him; let him inſtantly impart it to the Ferrier, and looke what the Ferrier doth give in directions, let his Keeper diligently obſerve, and execute accordingly; for it is an argument of a proud and prepoſterus condition in a Groome, to ſwarve from the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> which the Ferrier ſhall at any time give. Ninthly, as the Groome muſt have a ſpeciall care hee doe not pine, or under-meate his Horſe, in his dyet; ſo he muſt bee as cautelous hee doe not cloy him, by laying before him too much Provender at once: but his way muſt be to give him little at once, and often; he muſt eate up all before he give him any more, yea hee muſt eate it with good appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, otherwiſe he may marre his appetite utterly, and bring him to loath his Provender, and looke what Hay and Provender he doth at any time give him, let it be ſweet, wel-duſted, and throughly purged from Feathers, Hens-dung, Cats-dung, ſtones, gravell, and ſuch like filth, which are things hurtfull and troubleſome to his ſtomacke and feeding; for they will cauſe him to refuſe and forſake his meate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les pure hunger ſhall conſtrain him thereunto; for ſuch kind of naſty meate, &amp; food will engender in him noyſome &amp; noxious infirmities.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7066:32"/> Tenthly, as touching the furniture and capariſon which the horſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> is to weare, the Groome muſt be carefull to keep them clean, bright, and handſome: the Saddles, after ſweating and travell, well ayred in the Sun and wind, and after beaten and duſted, the ſtirrops wiped cleane, with the ſtrops and other ſuch like leathers thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and appertaining, and ſo put up ſafe and handſomely with their caſes and coverings upon them to preſerve them from duſt: the foot cloaths (if he have any under his charge) cleanſed, bruſhed, and neatly folded up; the Bits taken from the Head-ſtals, and cleane wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, dryed before the fire; and wrapped up in an oyly cloath to keep them from ruſt and canker, and the Boſſes carefully alſo made clean, together with their Bits, and ſo laid up in the Preſſe or Cheſt made for ſuch like purpoſe. The Head-ſtals and Reynes, Croopers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accoutrements would likewiſe be wiped, made very cleane, and hanged up in the Preſſe in their proper places: the Girts, Surſingles, Stirrip-leathers, and ſuch like neceſſaries, would be diligently viewed and examined, cleanſed, and made cleane, and if any thing be amiſſe or broken, let it be mended incontinently, leſt they ſhould be to doe when they were to be uſed: In concluſion, nothing ſhould be out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> order at any time, but every thing (as well Stable as Saddle-houſe) kept cleane, neat, and ſweet, which will purchaſe unto the Groome no ſmall reſpect with his Lord or Maſter, and much more reputation and applauſe of ſo many as ſhall be an eye-witneſſe thereof.</p>

                  <p>Moſt eaſily Sir, that the <hi>Gignitors</hi> cannot bee any one of the principall Members, reaſon teacheth us: for you cannot ſo much as touch any of theſe three, but you doe either kill the Creature out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, or elſe deſperately endanger him. Now ſuppoſing the <hi>Stones</hi> may fortune to receive hurt or domage, yet if I bee in deſpaire of healing or curing them, I can nevertheleſſe cut, or take them cleane away from the body, or cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fall away by other good means or by medicine, without perill of his life: he will only thereby looſe his naturall heat, whereby hee will bee diſenabled from having any diſpoſition to <hi>Coity,</hi> or power of <hi>Procreation.</hi>

But the <hi>heart</hi> which may be truely and rightly ſtiled the <hi>fountaine of life</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> nature hath aſſigned it its proper place, which is to be ſcituate in the center, that is the middle part of the <hi>body:</hi> from whence proceedeth life and heat into each organ of the <hi>body,</hi> by which meanes they are preſerved and enabled to perform their naturall and proper function. And as touching the <hi>cods,</hi> if the <hi>liver</hi> be not well ſtored, nay full of pure and perfect <hi>bloud,</hi> neither is the creature able to concoct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt its meat, nor can the <hi>cods</hi> be hot: ſo as if there be in thoſe parts a defect of heat, the <hi>ſeed</hi> of the beaſt cannot be perfectly concocted, by which meanes the Horſe becommeth frigid and impotent, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any power at all of <hi>Procreation.</hi> And this is as much as need be ſaid of this ſubject: wherein if I have any way erred, or not delivered my ſelf ſo cleerly whereby to be underſtood as I deſire, the blame muſt light upon the great deſire I promiſed to brevity: howſoever I have endeavoured what in me lyeth, to dilate and explicate my ſelf at full.</p>

                  <p>I thank you, then thus: As touching the compoſition of the <hi>body</hi> of the horſe, more I grant might have been ſpoken in words, but not more to purpoſe; for a man to runne into diviſions and ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, were but to beget confuſion in the unlearned Reader (ſuch are your ordinary Smiths for the moſt part, for whoſe inſtruction I doe principally undergoe theſe paines) and to ſend him away worſe ſatisfied in his judgement, than before. Whereas a plaine and ſuccinct methode doth more edifie and inſtruct him than the other can doe. I therefore demand of you <hi>Hyppoſerus,</hi> that foraſmuch as you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken well of the foure Elements; to wit, Fire, Ayre, Water, and Earth, yet have you not demonſtrated their natures, or where they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For true it is, my ſelfe and all men do perfectly know, that theſe foure elements are not theſe foure materiall and viſible elements which we daily behold and make uſe of, as things moſt uſefull for us towards the ſuſtentation of our livelihood: being creatures, without which we cannot live: but I would gladly have you ſhew what their true natures be, being things incorporate, and therefore concealed

                  <p>Sir, as touching the natures of theſe foure Elements, I have ſufficiently made appeare unto you in <hi>Capitulo praecedenti, poenè in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> but as touching the ſecond part of your demand, I ſay, that theſe foure elements which be in nature ſo diſſonant and diſtinct one from the other; as that nothing can be more, no white can be more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to blacke; nevertheleſſe that you may know theſe Elements, I thus averre.<note place="margin">The nature of the <hi>4.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements.</note> The Fire is higheſt, being neare neighbour or adjoyning to the Moone, and therefore naturally hot: Ayre is placed next unto it, and therefore naturally light. The Water is annexed to the Ayre, and therefore naturally moyſt. And the earth is ſcituate next to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but loweſt, and out of that reaſon naturally heavy. As touching their vertues all the learned doe hold,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Fire.</hi>
                     </note> that Fire by meanes of its heat, exciteth matter to Generation, and occaſioneth warmth in every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving body, and it doth ripen things raw and undigeſted, in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and ſubtle wiſe, as that the Ayre, which is of a more groſſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may the better enter into the <hi>body,</hi> making a commixture with the Fire, whereby alſo it moderateth the heat of the Fire, the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Water, and the dryneſſe of the Earth, ſo as diſtemper may the leſſe oppreſſe the <hi>Body.</hi>

                     </note> The Aire by reaſon of its moyſtnes maketh the matter apt to receive its naturall ſhape, and through the inſtinct of the Fire its naturall heat, cauſing the mixt <hi>Bodies</hi> as well ſubtle as penetrable, as well Light and moving, whereby they bee neither too groſſe nor too heavy, and withall the Ayre cooleth and abateth the extremity of the burning heat of the <hi>Heart,</hi>

                     <hi>Liver,</hi> &amp;c: As touching the third Element which is Water, its nature is that through the coldnes thereof it congealeth, conglutinateth, and bindeth in mixt <hi>Bodies</hi> both the parts and members together, to wit, <hi>Sinewes, Bones,</hi> &amp; <hi>Fleſh;</hi> ſo as the Water by meanes of its coldnes doth temper and aſſwage the violent heat of the Fire, and the condenſity of the Ayre,<note place="margin">4 <hi>Earth.</hi>
                     </note> collecting thoſe things together which they otherwiſe would have diſſevered. And as touching the Element of Earth, its nature is by meanes of its dryneſſe and Siccity, in mixt <hi>Bodyes,</hi> ſo to harden and faſten them together, as that having once aſſumed their Shaps, it cauſeth them to retein and keep them, which otherwiſe by the force of the other Elements would be ſo lax and looſe, as not to be able to hold together; wherein I could produce many familiar inſtances, which for brevities ſake I am enforced to omit. But the opinion of the beſt <hi>Phyſitians</hi> is, that when any naturall <hi>Body</hi> dyeth, the ſubſtance thereof returneth back againe to thoſe Elements from whence they came. Thus you may plainely ſee, that Fire is naturally hot, and therefore ſeparateth: Ayre moyſt, and therefore giveth Shape, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cold, and therefore bindeth: and Earth dry, and therefore natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hardneth, and keepeth its impreſſion: Wherefore in any Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a <hi>Horſe,</hi> obſerve but this one Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> that when at any time
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7066:46"/> an Inflamation ſhall ariſe in the <hi>Body,</hi> be you confident it proceeds of Fire, and therefore you muſt adminiſter (if you will performe a right Cure) things contrary to that Element: to wit; what may be agreeable to Ayre and Water, whereby to moyſten, coole, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the rage of the heat.

And laſtly, if the griefe be Maingeneſſe, or the like, which cometh from the Earth, which be dry and arid infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, then muſt your applications be had from the Element of Fire, whoſe nature is to diſſolve all ſiccative humours: Wherefore (I ſay againe) that heat being too predominant is aſſwaged by the meanes of moyſtneſſe and coldneſſe: too great moyſtneſſe by heat and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, over-much coldneſſe by heat and drynes, and too great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of dryneſſe by heat alone.</p>

But if your <hi>horſe</hi> doe feed upon Straw, then will the colour of his <hi>doung</hi> be yellow and ſomewhat hard, long, and well compact, all which be tokens of a healthy and a ſound <hi>body;</hi> but if it be reddiſh, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dry, it is a ſign of enſuing ſickneſſe, by means of a great drought in the <hi>body,</hi> and ſo alſo if it be thin: but if it be blackiſh, and doth not ſmell ſtrong, then is it a ſigne that the <hi>horſe</hi> is in danger of death. But if your <hi>horſe</hi> doe feed upon Hay and Oates, and that he be ſound in <hi>body,</hi> then will his <hi>Excrements</hi> be a brown yellow, moyſt, and well compact, but if the browneſſe be converted into reddiſhneſſe, you may be then well aſſured that he hath ſome diſtemperature in his <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> but when it converteth into blackneſſe, then if prevention be not ſpeedily had, death enſueth: and as touching the ſmell, that falleth out according to the quantity of the provender you give him, for the more provender, the ſtronger will be the ſmell of his <hi>Ordure,</hi> and Peaſe and Beanes will cauſe his <hi>Ordure</hi> to ſmell ſtronger than Oats, and bread more than any Grayne or Pulſe; and the more bread and Provender you give him, the more perfect and ſound ſhall you keep him in his <hi>body.</hi> But if his <hi>doung</hi> be brown and ſlimy, and ſhine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, then be you aſſured he hath much greace which lyeth in his body, which Phyſicke muſt fetch away from him, for then alſo is his <hi>bloud</hi> putrified, corrupted, or enflamed.

But if it bee of a pale greeniſh colour thick, and viſcous, then certainely his <hi>Backe</hi> is growne weake, and he is in danger of a <hi>Conſumption</hi> of his <hi>Seede.</hi> But if it be high colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and nebuled or mixed with ſmall Cloudes, with a kind of black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therein, then this doth demonſtrate enſuing ſickneſſe and death, if it be not carefully prevented. But if the Nebuloſity be diſperſed into ſeverall parts, and not combined as it were into one <hi>Maſſe</hi> or <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> this then argueth, that the malice of the diſeaſe beginneth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, whereby the <hi>Ferrier</hi> may have great hope of the health of the <hi>Horſe:</hi> And thus farre I have by diligent obſervation found to bee moſt certaine, Whereby I have brought many a deſperate Malady to it's wiſhed Cure, which otherwiſe I could not ſo eaſily have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>

                     <p>His reaſon is good, Sir, and I will approve of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein: for if any man ſhould make ſo great a quantity toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Maſter <hi>Blundevile</hi> doth ſet downe in his Receipt, it would not be ſpent whilſt it were good, but only by ſuch a <hi>Ferrier</hi> as hath daily uſe thereof, and ſuch an one wilbe hardly found; for the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and oftner ſuch like <hi>Receipts</hi> are made, the better they be, and yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more profit when they be adminiſtred.</p>

But both my Maſter and my ſelfe doe commonly adminiſter two Spoonefulls at the moſt at a time, in a pint of white Wine, or with a quart of good Ale or Beere, which we hold to be much better and ſafer, and we have found it evermore to worke to our hearts deſire: inſomuch as wee have both wrought admirable Cures therewith, I doe aſſure you.</p>

                     <p>Yes Sir, there is ſuch a diſeaſe, but it ſo ſeldome comes to a Horſe, as that few Ferriers have had occaſion to cure the ſame; by reaſon very few know it, and therefore marvell not in that they cannot cure the ſame. Saint <hi>Anthonies Fire</hi> is that burneth in the fleſh moſt extreamely, and hath in it ſo great malice, as that look what you do apply to the place (unleſſe you hit the cure right) it will doe it no good, but more harme, much after the nature of a <hi>Noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> or <hi>wild-fire.</hi> This diſeaſe is alſo called by ſome the <hi>ſhingles</hi> in a Horſe, and like as the Diſeaſe it ſelf is very rare, and ſeldome known in a Horſe, ſo alſo is the cure as uncouth and ſtrange. For my part I will not profeſſe my ſelfe to be any whit more skilfull then indeed I am: this diſeaſe I never yet obſerved to be in any Horſe: I only have heard ſome Ferriers talke thereof, but yet I never heard but of one man, who was ever truely able to make a Cure thereof; and this was a Knight of very good worſhip who taught it me, he averring confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently unto me; how that he had cured three ſeverall Horſes of this very malady. I asked him whence this diſeaſe proceedeth, and what are the ſymptomes whereby to know the ſame; he anſwered me, that he could never rightly come to be mathematically aſſured how it breedeth, or occurreth to the Horſe, but by gueſſe onely, and that himſelfe thought it came from ſome <hi>cholericke bloud</hi> paſſing to his <hi>head</hi> into the <hi>braine</hi> and <hi>pannicles,</hi> which cauſeth the Horſe to become ſtarke mad, yea ſo truely mad, as to be deprived of his memory, in not knowing his <hi>Keeper,</hi> or any other body elſe; yea his fury is ſo great, as to reſiſt ſtripes, to ſlight and contemne correction be it never ſo ſevere, he will endeavour what in him lyeth to perpetrate what miſchiefe he is able, by biting, ſtriking, and endangering whom or whatſoever thing commeth into his way, and when he cannot have his minde of living <hi>creatures</hi> whereupon to wreake his malice, then will he doe it partly upon dead creatures, by biting and gnawing the Manger and Racke-ſtaves, and by ſtriking the poſts and barres with his <hi>heeles,</hi> and partly upon himſelfe by beating his <hi>head</hi> againſt the wall and ground;<note place="margin">S. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> fire.</note> he will alſo forſake both his meat and ſleep, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reſt, untill he dyeth, if he be not in time cured, which is thus.</p>

                     <p>Take firſt help enough, and caſt him, which done, take a <hi>worme</hi> which groweth in a <hi>Fullers Teaſell,</hi> and put this <hi>worme</hi> alive, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hurt into a <hi>quill:</hi> then ſlit the <hi>skin</hi> of <hi>the fore-head</hi> of the <hi>horſe</hi> under the <hi>fore-top,</hi> and open the ſame round about with your <hi>cornet,</hi> making a concavity an inch round every way and better, betwixt the <hi>skin</hi> and the <hi>bone:</hi> which done, blow the ſaid Worme out of the <hi>quill</hi> into the place which you made hollow as aforeſaid; but take heed you doe not kill the Worme in ſtitching up the <hi>skin</hi> againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Worme may not get forth: and after twenty dayes the Worm will dye, and in that time the Horſe will be throughly cured.

                     <p>Sir, I ſay it is a diſeaſe whereunto Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are oft times enclined, and it commeth ſundry wayes, to wit, ſometimes with too much feeding without exerciſe, ſometimes of too hard and immoderate riding or other labour; both which waies the <hi>bloud</hi> of the creature becommeth corrupted and inflamed, which maketh its reſidence in and about the heart, which if it ſhould not have a way to make its vent, it would quickly kill him, by which meanes many good Horſes dye ſuddenly, and the cauſe unknowne. This Diſeaſe is apparent to the <hi>eye</hi> by a ſwelling which will ariſe in the middle of the <hi>breaſt</hi> juſt againſt the <hi>heart</hi> from whence it taketh its name, which if it be not ſoone prevented, will aſcend to the <hi>throat,</hi> and then it is certaine death. It commeth likewiſe by ſurfets taken by heats and colds, ſometimes alſo by Feavers, which are malignant, and ſometimes againe by feeding upon unwholeſome meats. The ſignes to know this diſeaſe before the ſwelling doe appeare are theſe: he will be ſicke and grone many times when he is layed, he will hang down his head, and forſake his meat; and then if he ſhould deſire to eate, what meat he loveth beſt, whether Hay, Graſſe, Provender, or Bread, lay it upon the ground before him, and if he hath a minde to eate thereof, albeit he make proffer to bring his <hi>mouth</hi> towards it, yet he ſhall not be able to reach it, but will ſooner famiſh: when you doe perceive the ſwelling to appeare, firſt draw bloud from both the <hi>Plate-veynes,</hi> but if you cannot finde them, then let him <hi>bloud</hi> on both ſides of the <hi>necke</hi> to a good proportion; which done, you may give him the drinke of <hi>Diapente</hi> with Beere or Ale, putting thereinto one ounce of browne ſugar candy, and halfe an ounce of <hi>London Treacle,</hi> which will drive the ſickneſſe and griefe from his <hi>heart;</hi> which done, annoynt the ſwelling with this Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Take Hogges greaſe, Bores greace, and Baſilicon,<note place="margin">Anticor.</note> of each three ounces, incorporate all theſe well into one body, and annoynt and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7066:56"/> rub the ſwelling therewith every day till it come to a ſoftneſſe, and then open it, and let forth all the corrupted matter: then waſh the Sore with your Coperas water mentioned in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. § 4. and then put in your green Oyntment preſcribed you in <hi>capite ibidem,</hi> and it will be ſoon whole. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Thus have I cured many Horſes of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and I never failed if the Horſe had not been ſwelled too high towards the <hi>throat</hi> or <hi>necke,</hi> before I took him in hand. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Blundeviles</hi> and Maſter <hi>Markhams</hi> cure for an <hi>Anticor,</hi> is thus.</p>
                     <p>Firſt they let him <hi>bloud</hi> in the <hi>plate-veins,</hi> and then they give him this drinke. Take a quart of Malmeſey, and put thereto halfe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of Sugar, and of Cinamon two ounces, and ſo give it him bloud-warme, and keep him warme in the Stable, eſpecially his <hi>breaſt,</hi> that no winde doe offend him; and for his drinke, let it be warm Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and ſuch meat as he will eate. And if the ſwelling doe appeare, then beſides letting him <hi>bloud,</hi> they doe ſtrike the ſwelling in divers places with their flegme, that the corruption may goe forth, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the place with warme Hogges greaſe, and that will cauſe it to weare away, or elſe grow to a head if it be kept warme. Thus Maſter <hi>Blundevile,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Markhams</hi> cure is in effect the very ſame. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Markham</hi> alſo preſcribeth Malmeſey and <hi>Diapente,</hi> which is uſed alſo by others, and it is very good: and he alſo ſaith that ſome do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter <hi>Doctor Stephens water,</hi> whith he affirmeth he hath ſeen to have wrought in this kinde ſtrange effects. For my part I ſubmit, for that theſe <hi>Receits</hi> ſeeme very probable; howſoever I never did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment any but that onely which I firſt inſerted, which I had of a famous Ferrier in <hi>France,</hi> and therefore I finding mine to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, made tryall of none other.</p>

Take one or two handfuls of Saxafrage, and all the Sewet of a Loine of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and a pint of white Wine; chop the Hearb, and mince the Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et very ſmall; and ſo boyle all theſe together, which being thus well boyled, take a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Horſe-dung</hi> newly made by a <hi>Horſe</hi> that goeth to graſſe, and putting it to the other Ingredients, worke it to a Salve, and apply it plaiſter-wiſe to the place good hot, renewing it twice every day for ſo long time as you ſhall think to be convenient.</p>
                     <p>Now Maſter <hi>Blundevile,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Markham</hi> doe both agree in the Cure of an <hi>Attaint</hi> which is thus: Firſt, waſh and bath the place with warme Water, and ſhave the haire ſo farre as the ſwelling go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; then ſcarrifie the ſore place with the point of a Razor, that the bloud may iſſue forth: Then take Cantharides and Euforbium, of each halfe an ounce, powdered, and mingle them together with a quarterne of Sope, and with a ſhy ſpread ſome of the Oyntment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the ſore, ſuffering him to reſt in the place where you dreſſed him for one halfe houre after, and then you may take him into the Stable, there letting him ſtand without Litter, and ſo tyed that hee may not touch the ſore with his <hi>Mouth,</hi> and then the next day uſe him in the ſame manner againe; then the third day annoint the place with freſh Butter; continuing ſo to doe by the ſpace of nine dayes, and at nine daies end, make him this bath.</p>
                     <p>Take Mallowes three handfulls, a Roſe-Cake, and Sage of each a handfull: boyle them together in a ſufficient quantity of faire wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and when the Mallowes are become ſoft, put in halfe a pound of Butter, and halfe a pint of Sallet Oyle, and then being ſomewhat warme; waſh and bath the ſore place therewith every day once, till it be whole. This Medicine I confeſſe I never tryed, but I think it very good. Maſter <hi>Blundevile</hi> hath only this, but Maſter <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> hath ſundry others: ſome of which, I will relate, to the end the <hi>Ferrier</hi> may make his choyce. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take Dialthea, Agrippa, and Oyle, and mixing theſe together lay it to the ſwelling. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take alſo Frankinſence, Roſin, Tarre, Euforbium, Turpentine, Fennugrick, of each a quarter of an ounce, of Sewet one ounce, of Oyle one ounce, of Wax three ounces, &amp; three quarters of an ounce of Myrrh; mix and melt all theſe together, and plaiſter-wiſe lay it to the place till it be whole.

                        <note place="margin">Aviues.</note> it is called the <hi>Fives</hi> or <hi>Vives</hi> from the <hi>Eares</hi> it creepeth downe towards the <hi>Throate,</hi> which when they begin to enflame will ſwell, and not only paine the <hi>Horſe</hi> very much, but alſo prove mortall, by ſtopping his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7066:58"/> 
                        <hi>Wind</hi> they will kill him out right, if it be not in time cured; and I my ſelfe have ſeene and knowne <hi>Horſes</hi> dy of this malady. It proceedeth moſt commonly of Rankneſſe of <hi>Bloud:</hi> in the cure, care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that you doe not touch the Graynes or Kernells with your fin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers The <hi>Avives</hi> or <hi>Vives</hi> are certaine flat Kernells, much like Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Grapes which grow in a cluſter, cloſe knotted together in the place; the moſt certaine cure is to cut the <hi>Skin</hi> longeſt-wayes, and to lay the Kernells or Graines open, and then with an Inſtrument made like to a paire of Pliers to pinch forth the Graynes, then to apply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place eyther a linnen-cloth, or a few hurds ſteeped well in whites of Egges well beaten, and ſo bound on, and renewing it day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will cure it: but you muſt heale up the <hi>Skin</hi> with the Greene-Oyntment before ſpoken of <hi>in Cap. &amp;</hi> §. <hi>Ib.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>. But the common cure is to draw downe the ſore with a hot Iron juſt in the midſt, ſo farre as the ſwelling goeth, and then under the roote of the <hi>Eare,</hi> draw two other ſtrokes of the faſhion of an arrowes head, then open the <hi>skin,</hi> and with a ſmall payre of plyers, pull out the kernels, and ſo cut them off, but have a care of the <hi>veine:</hi> that done, fill the place with Bay-ſalt made into fine powder, and after heale up the ſore with the aforeſaid Oyntment. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>. This have I alſo practiſed, and performed the Cure, but with greater difficulty than the former, by reaſon of the Fire which I put to the place, and therefore I doe hold my former Cure the better, ſafer, and ſpeedier. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>.</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Blundevile</hi> and Maſter <hi>Markham</hi> doe ſay, that the <hi>Italians</hi> uſe to take a ſpunge well dipped in ſtrong wine vineger, and bound to the Sore, renewing it twice a day till the kernels doe rot; then they open the neather moſt part of the ſoftneſſe, and ſo let the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption forth, and then fill the hole with ſalt finely brayed: and the next day they waſh away the filth with warme water, and the next day after, they annoynt the Sore with Honey and Fich flower min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together till it be whole. This Cure I never made tryall of, but it ſeemeth to me to be a very good and probable Cure. Another for the Avives.</p>
                     <p>Take Tarre, tryed Hogges greaſe, Bay-ſalt, and Frankinſence powdred, of each ſo much as will ſuffice, melt theſe on the fire all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then with a clout faſtened to the end of a ſticke, boyling hot ſcald the places 4 or 5 mornings one after another, untill the enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med places doe become ſoft and ripe. Then with your inciſion knife ſlit the skin, and let forth the corruption: then to heale up the ſoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, take tryed Hogges greaſe and Verdigreaſe made into fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, melt them upon a gentle fire, but ſuffer it not to boyle more then a waume or two at the moſt, then take it off, and put to it of ordinary Turpentine, as much as will ſuffice, and ſo ſtirre all together untill it be cold. And herewith annoint the ſorances daily, till they be whole: <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is very good.</p>
                     <p>Maſter <hi>Markham</hi> in his <hi>Maſter piece,</hi> hath a Cure for the <hi>Avives,</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:7066:58"/> which he intituleth; <hi>A moſt rare and certaine approved Medicine, which will cure the Vives without either burning, melting, rotting, or any ſuch like violent exerciſe.</hi> But as yet I did never experiment the ſame. The cure is this.</p>
                     <p>Take a penniworth of pepper, beaten to fine powder, Swines greaſe a ſpoonefull, the juyce of Rue a handfull, and of Vineger two ſpoonfuls, mixe all well together, and convey it equally into both the <hi>eares</hi> of the Horſe, and ſo tye or ſtitch them up, then ſhake his <hi>eares</hi> that the medicine may ſinke downewards: which done, you ſhall let him <hi>bloud</hi> in the <hi>neck-veyne,</hi> and in the <hi>temple-veine.</hi> And this (ſaith he) <hi>is an infallible cure.</hi>

                     <p>We have many wayes to cure a Malady of this nature: if the place be ſwelled, and yet not ripe enough to be opened, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that remedy which you ſhall finde taught you hereafter, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve or ripen the ſame: and when it is ripe, put your inciſion knife unto it, or a hot iron, and ſo open it in the loweſt part, ſo as the putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction may the more eaſily paſſeaway; then every morning inject this <hi>Lotion</hi> with a Seringe; which is thus to be made, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <note place="margin">Backe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note>Take Honey-ſuckle leaves, Plantine, Ribwort, Yarrow, Burſa-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoris, Knot-graſſe, and Cumphrey, of each halfe a handfull, boyle theſe in a quantity of running water, till a moity be conſumed, then ſtraine the herbs from the water, caſting away the hearbs, and then ſet the water upon the fire again, and ſo ſoon as it beginneth to boyle againe, put into the ſaid water hony of Roſes, one ounce, Allum and Alkenet, of each two drams, ſtirre all theſe well together, and let it boyle till theſe latter ingredients be well diſſolved, then take it from the fire, and when it is cold, put it into a cleane glaſſe, keeping it cloſe ſtopped for your uſe.

                     <p>Take water and ſalt, and boyle them well together, and firſt waſh the ſore place therewith.

                     <p>I have onely three cures for it, whereof I never had occaſion to make tryall; howbeit they were all recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto me for ſpeciall good: the firſt is.</p>
                     <p>Take the tendertops of Rue, Boxe-leaves, and Primroſe-roots,<note place="margin">Biting of mad Dog.</note> of each a handfull, pound them together in a morter, and put them into a quart of new milke, with <hi>London</hi> Treacle one ounce, and ſo give it him bloud warme. This proportion will ſerve very well for two Horſes. Another,</p>
                     <p>Take Hobgoblin, perewincle, and Boxe leaves, of each one handfull, firſt mince them ſmall, and then ſtampe them very ſmall in a ſtone morter, and with milke or beere adminiſter it, both at the Change or Full of the Moone. A third cure I alſo have, which is this:</p>
                     <p>Take the hearb which groweth in dry and barren hils, called <hi>The Starre of the earth;</hi> you muſt give it three dayes together; the firſt time you muſt gather three of theſe hearbs with all the whole roots, and waſh them cleane, and wipe them cleane, then pound them well, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no part of them; which done, give it your Horſe in Milke, Beer, Ale, or white Wine; but be carefull the Horſe take all the hearbs and roots: but if you will, you may make up theſe hearbs and roots in freſh or ſweet butter which will doe as well: the ſecond day give your Horſe five of theſe hearbs and roots, like as you gave him them the day before; and the third day give him ſeaven. Doe this punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as I have here preſcribed you, and be you well aſſured your Horſe will be perfectly cured: for albeit I my ſelfe have never tryed this medicine, yet I doe know the party of whom I had this Cure, hath cured much cattell of all ſorts therewith, for it cureth all ſorts of living creatures which ſhall be bitten by a <hi>mad Dog;</hi> I my ſelfe can ſay thus much of this Receit, that I knew it cure a whole <hi>kennell</hi> of <hi>Hounds</hi> of a Gentlemans, one Beagle excepted which they did not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7066:63"/> ſuſpect to be bitten, which indeed was bitten, ſo he fell mad and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but all the reſidue eſcaped and did very well. Another time a <hi>Gentlemans</hi> ſonne of my acquaintance was unfortunately bitten by a mad Dog, who was cured by the party who taught me this Receit, and this young <hi>Gentleman</hi> (for he was then but a boy of ten yeares old) was ſo farre ſpent with the rancor of the diſeaſe, before this man tooke him in hand, as that his <hi>head</hi> began to he addle, and he to talke very idly, yet he cured him, ſo as he lived and did well, and is at this houre living, he being now come to mans ſtate, and a very handſome and proper man, whoſe Parents whilſt they lived, I very well knew, and with whom I was very intimately acquainted. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>

                     <p>We have two ſorts of <hi>Spavens:</hi> the one we call a Through wet, Bloud or Bog-Spaven; the other a Dry, or Bone-Spaven: the firſt of theſe two is eaſily cured; the ſecond may be cured, but ſuch a cure is not for every Ferrier to take upon him to compaſſe: for that it is a Cure of very great difficulty, and of no leſſe danger. To ſpeake therefore firſt of the <hi>Bloud Spaven,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bloud-Spaven.</note> it is a Diſeaſe which groweth upon the <hi>hough,</hi> with a ſwelling which is full of <hi>bloud,</hi> which though it be greateſt upon the inſide, yet the ſwelling appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alſo upon the outſide, being fed and nouriſhed by the great <hi>veine</hi> which runneth along the inſide of the <hi>thigh,</hi> and ſo commeth along the inſide of the <hi>hough,</hi> and ſo downe the <hi>legge</hi> to the <hi>paſterne,</hi> and ſo from the <hi>paſtern</hi> to the bottome of the <hi>foot.</hi> This malady com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by meanes that the bloud is corrupted through hard riding, eſpecially when the Horſe is very young. Now the <hi>bloud</hi> being through over much heating too much ſtirred, it begetteth a fluxible <hi>humour,</hi> which being marvellous thin, falleth to running downwards towards its center, but it is ſtopped in its paſſage in the <hi>hough,</hi> where it reſideth, and by that meanes ſwelleth, and ſo becommeth a diſeaſe, which peſtring that place, makes the <hi>joynt</hi> ſtiffe, whereby he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſtarke lame, not being able to goe, but with great difficulty and paine. The ſigne is moſt eaſie, being moſt apparant to the <hi>eye.</hi> The beſt way to cure it, is: firſt, to ſhave away the haire on both ſides the ſwelling, ſo farre forth as the ſwelling goeth: then take up the <hi>thigh veine,</hi> and let it <hi>bleed</hi> well; which done, tye the <hi>veine</hi> above the <hi>orefice,</hi> and let the <hi>veine</hi> bleed from below what it will; whereby the bloud which was aſſembled about the ſpaven place, which cauſed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſwelling, is by this meanes ſent away: then with your fleame or inciſion knife, make two inciſions in the lower part of the ſwelling, and after prick two or three holes in each ſide of the <hi>hough</hi> where the Spaven is, that the medicine may take the better effect, and when the <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>water</hi> hath vented away ſo much, as it will doe, bind round
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7066:63"/> about it, plaiſter-wiſe the whites of Egges and Bolearmonack very well beaten together, either upon hurds or linnen cloath, and make it faſt about the <hi>hough,</hi> ſo keep on the plaiſter. The next day take it off, and waſh and bathe the ſorance with this <hi>bath, viz.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bath for Bloud-Spaven.</note> Take M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and the tops of nettles, and boyle them in water till they be ſoft, and therewith <hi>bath</hi> him. Then take Mallow-roots, Brancha Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina, Oyle, Waxe, and white Wine, ſo much as wil ſuffice, and boyle them, binde this warme to the ſorance round about the <hi>hough,</hi> and ſew a cloath about it, and ſo let it remaine three dayes more; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning ſtroke it downewards with both your <hi>hands</hi> gently, to the end the <hi>bloudy humour</hi> may iſſue forth. The fourth day <hi>bathe</hi> and waſh it very cleane with the former <hi>Bath.</hi> That done, Take Carana, and ſtone Pitch, of each one ounce, and of Brimſtone a quarter of an ounce made into very fine powder: melt theſe together on the fire, and when it is almoſt ready to be taken off, put into it of Venice Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine halfe an ounce, and make a plaiſter thereof, ſpreading it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leather, and apply it to the place warme, round about the <hi>hough,</hi> and ſo let it remaine untill it doe fall away of its own accord: or if it doe come off ſooner than you might thinke fitting, then make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plaiſter of the like ingredients, and apply it as before. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is the beſt cure that I could ever know for this malady, with which I have cured many <hi>Bloud-Spavens.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another for a Bloud-Spaven.</p>
                     <p>When the ſwelling doth appeare upon the inward part of the hough, take up the thigh veine, and let it bleed from the nether part of the leg, till it will bleed no longer, and after give fire to the Spaven both longſt-wayes and croſſe-wayes, and then apply a reſtringent charge to the place, and thus it will be cured. This I never tryed, but poſitively ſpeaking, I hold it to be a very good Cure.</p>

Secondly, the Horſe may have this malady by inheritance or kinde either from the Sire or Damme, as I have before ſpecified in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt Booke,

The beſt way to cure it, is firſt by taking up the <hi>thigh-veine,</hi> which cauſed it, and fed and nouriſhed it, and let him bleed will, and ſo put him into the Stable, and doe no more to him for that day; the next day, ſhave away the haire from off the <hi>Spaven,</hi> and rub it hard with a Rowling-pin (having firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted the place with <hi>Petroleum</hi> and chafed it well in with your hand) or ſome other round and ſmooth ſtick, morning and evening for foure daies together, and at the fourth dayes end, ſlit downe the skin with your Inciſion-knife, the full length of the <hi>Spaven;</hi> but bee very carefull you do not touch the great <hi>Artery</hi> or <hi>Veine,</hi> both which do ly very neere; for if you do never ſo little hurt the great <hi>Artery,</hi> you utterly maime the <hi>horſe</hi> paſt all recovery; having thus done, lay to the place the Hearb called <hi>Flamula</hi> bruiſed, and bind it on that it fall not off, for two dayes more; then for three daies after: Take Cantharides &amp; Euforbium, &amp; incorporate them well together, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before beaten into fine powder) with black Sope, and Bay ſalt, and lay this to the place, and thus dreſſe it every Morning: this will lay the <hi>Bone</hi> and Cruſt bare. After take Fearne-roots, Hounds-tongu, and Bore-greaſe; incorporate all theſe together, and lay it to the place, untill you perceive the Cruſt to be looſe, and to bee waſted; aſſay now and then to looſen the ſame with your Cornet or other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and if you can with conveniency take it off quite, doe ſo: Which done, heale up the wound with your greene oyntment pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed you in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. §. 4. you may alſo apply to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance after the aforeſaid Coraſives, a Plaiſter of ſtrong <hi>Aegiptiacum</hi> till it hath fretted off the fleſh upon the Cruſt ſo bare as poſſibly may be, and ſo you may the better attempt the taking away of the ſaid Cruſt, or by rubbing it with a Rowling-pin, or a Haſell-ſtick annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Petroleum</hi> till the Cruſt be converted into a mattrative ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or other thinner kind of corruption, which may very eaſily be drawne away.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7066:66"/> too rank of <hi>bloud,</hi> or by too much glut and fouleneſſe in the <hi>body,</hi> then is he ſubject to ſhortneſſe of breath and purſiveneſſe; ſo as upon any motion or exerciſe he will ſweat, pant, blow, and heave at the <hi>flanks;</hi> and this commeth upon him by immoderate riding, eating, drinking, and reſt. And ſuch like exerciſe cauſeth the <hi>panch</hi> of the Horſe (if he be put to any ſudden motion or exerciſe) to be ſo hard and ſtrutted out, as that he muſt ſo ſtraine his <hi>longs, (the bellowes of the body)</hi> as to cauſe a diſlocation in them, by meanes whereof they cannot execute their office or function as they ought; and if care and remedy be not ſpeedily had, he will in ſhort time be paſt all recovery; and then hee is brought to that diſeaſe which the vulgar doe call <hi>broken-winded:</hi> wherefore to prevent it, adminiſter unto him this enſuing Cure.</p>
                     <p>Let all the hay he eateth, (nor let him eate all he deſireth, for ſuch Horſes are commonly great feeders) be ſprinckled and moyſtened with water, which will aſſwage his exceſſe of drinking, and very much coole his <hi>bloud,</hi> which cannot but be inflamed. Then give him every morning for foure or five dayes together, two egges ſteeped twenty foure houres in the ſtrongeſt white wine vineger you can get: give him (I ſay) theſe two egges, and then the vineger after, then ride him ſoftly an houre after: which done, ſet him up warme, and three houres after, give him hay ſprinckled with water, and at night when you do give him his Oats, wet them in Beere or good Ale, and let his drinke be white water. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Doe this ten dayes together, ſo that about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> and about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> he may be in breath: and ſo keep him to ſpare dyet, but with diſcretion. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This medicine will both purge him, and ſcowre from him much flegme and filth as well at <hi>noſe</hi> as <hi>mouth,</hi> and he will be both ſounder and in better health a long time after: provided he be alſo kept to moderate exerciſe. And if after you have thus drenched and dyeted him, you doe not perceive his blowing and lifting at the <hi>ribbes</hi> and <hi>flanks</hi> to ceaſe, then be you confident your Horſe is paſt all cure, onely ſtill moyſten his meat as before is inculcated, and he will hold out the longer. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another Receit I have for the ſame malady, which if he be not paſt all cure, will infallibly doe him much good, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take wheate meale, the powder of Lung-wort, <hi>alias</hi> Mullet, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiana, Anniſeeds, Comin-ſeeds, of each three drammes, make them into fine powder, and make paſte with them with honey, and freſh butter, of each like quantity, ſo much as will ſuffice, and put to it the yolkes of two new laid egges; make this paſte into pils, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning faſting give him three or foure of theſe pils rowled up in the powder of Enulacampana, and the powder of Licoris, of each like much. Theſe pils preſerve the winde of the Horſe mervailouſly, and keeps him alwaies in breath, and therefore good they be often uſed. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of theſe two Receits I have had great experience, and a third I
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7066:66"/> was taught, whereof I had not oft made triall, yet with that little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I have had of it, I doe find it to be right good, being as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                     <p>Take the Excrements of a ſucking child, and put unto it a pint of white wine; let it boyle till the one halfe be conſumed, and ſo give it him blood-warme. This will cauſe him to forſake his blowing for 15. dayes; ſo as when hee beginneth againe to blow, give him the ſame medicine againe, and ſo keep him with this from time to time ſo oft as you ſhall have cauſe, and by this meanes you ſhall have his wind good. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> But then you muſt beware you put not into the wine too large a proportion of the Excrements, for it will make him to be very ſick, and peradventure endanger him, for howſoever when at any time you doe adminiſter it, it will make him very ſick. Remember alſo to ſprinkle his meat, and to give him white water.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Egremony one handfull, chop and ſtamp it ſmall, and put unto it a quart of new milke, with brimſtone made into very fine powder, halfe an ounce: give this to your Horſe faſting bloud-warm, and keep him upon the trench faſting three houres at the leaſt, and at night give him white water. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another.</p>

When you are to give it him, take forth his <hi>tongue,</hi> and make him ſwallow the whole pill, then ride him a while up and downe, and after ſet him up warme, cauſing him to faſt three houres after: and with this medicine you may kill all manner of <hi>Bots, Trunchions,</hi> and <hi>wormes,</hi> of what kinde ſoever, yet at the giving, you muſt be wondrous circumſpect and carefull; for this <hi>Precipitate</hi> is a very ſtrong poyſon, wherefore you muſt be very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of your proportion, wherein you ought not to exceed, except with good caution. Againe, if you mixe your <hi>Precipitate</hi> before hand with a little ſweet butter, the quantity of a haſell-nut; and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards lap it up in the greater lump of butter, it may be received by

But this I leave to your own diſcretion, aſſuring you that there is hardly any thing comparable to this, for this diſeaſe. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This Receit I have adminiſtred unto three Horſes onely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt and laſt I cured, but the ſecond dyed under my hands: but I doe aſſure you not for any want of care. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another:</p>

Take of Lard one pound, let it be laid in water two houres, then take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the pure fat thereof onely, beat it well in a ſtone morter, and put thereto of Anniſeeds, Licoris, and Fennugrick, all made into fine powder, of each halfe an ounce, Aloes powdred, two drams, and of Agaricke one ounce: make all theſe well mixed into one body, and divide them equally into ſixe Pils or Bals, then the Horſe having fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted over night, give him in the morning three of theſe Pils, annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted firſt with honey, then cloath him up, and litter him well, and keep the Stable warme, and at night give him a ſweet Maſh, and for three dayes after, let him have none other drinke then white water.

                     <p>But I will now give you two or three other unguents, which are moſt precious againſt all ſorts of burnings, which is this.</p>
                     <p>Take Hogges greaſe as much as will ſuffice, ſet it upon the fire, and let it boyle well, and as the skimme ariſeth, take it away with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or ſuch like thing, untill no more will ariſe; that done, and that it hath boyled enough, then put it forth into an earthen veſſell, and ſet it forth into the open ayre foure or five nights, after which time you muſt waſh it in a great quantity of cleere running or fountaine water, to the end it may be free from ſalt or other filth, and waſh it ſo long in ſundry waters in ſome great bowle, until it come to be very white, Then melt onely this oyntment, and ſo keep it for your uſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with annoynt the places grieved, and in ſhort time it will cure them. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This I had of a famous French Mariſhall, and I have often uſed it, and I ever found it to be moſt ſoveraigne for all ſorts of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.

The way to free your Horſe of them, is firſt: take up ſuch veines as you may know to feed them; then ſhave away the hayre from about the places, and for foure dayes together, lay <hi>Aegiptiacum</hi> to them; at foure dayes end, waſh and bathe the places with ſtrong wine vineger made hot; then take wine vineger one pinte, green coperas and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers gals, of each foure ounces, cantharides two ounces, bay ſalt one handfull, make theſe into fine powder, and let them boyle on the fire with the vineger a little, and ſo waſh the ſorances therewith ſcalding hot, and every third day continue thus to doe till you perceive them to dry up. Let the ſcurfe fall away of its own accord at leiſure, if any more ſhall happen to grow forth afterwards, apply the ſame medicine againe, albeit it was formerly cured by the ſame thing: yet I have not ſeen any Horſe to fall into the ſame malady againe, and during the time you have him in cure, let him not come in any water, but keep him in the ſtable warme. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another cure is this: Firſt (as before) ſhave away the <hi>hayre,</hi> and take up the <hi>veins</hi> which feed thoſe ſoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then ſixe dayes after, let him <hi>bloud</hi> in the <hi>heeles</hi> to draw away the <hi>humours</hi> downwards: then waſh and bathe him well with hot vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; which done, take a quart of oyle of Nuts, and Verdegreace powdred two ounces, and a quarter of a pinte of Inke; mixe all theſe well together, and apply it cold to the places, rubbing and bathing them well therewith, and if the knots and warts doe not begin to dry up at the firſt dreſſing, then muſt you begin again every fourth day untill ſuch time as they be throughly cured. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another, Take courſe honey one pound, Verdegreace in powder three ounces, mixe theſe well together with the fineſt wheat flowre, and ſo bring it to an oyntment, and after you have cleanſed the ſorances as before is ſhewed you, apply this oyntment to the place with a rowler: if there be any warts among the knots, cut them away cleane before you doe apply the ſaid oyntment, and thus doing ten or twelve dayes every other day, he will be perfectly cured. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another: Shave away the <hi>hayre,</hi> and take up the <hi>veins</hi> as aforeſaid, then waſh and bath the place well, then take mutton ſewet, mallowes, and brimſtone, make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction hereof, &amp; when you have very well bathed the ſorances with the ſaid decoction, take the ſubſtance thereof, and putting it between two linnen cloaths, make it faſt to the place over night, and in the morning take it away, which done, apply unto the place this unguent, <hi>viz.</hi>

Of this Cure I never made tryall, but it ſeemeth to be a good one. You muſt not forget in every of theſe Cures to take up ſuch <hi>veines</hi> which in your judgement you may finde to feed thoſe ſorances, and to ſhave away the <hi>hayre</hi> from about them cleane. Now with this other Cure, I will conclude. Waſh and bathe the places with the decoction laſt before mentioned, and lay the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the ſores. Take then new Waxe, Turpentine, and Gum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabicke, of each like much: melt them to an unguent, and herewith annoint the ſorances; during which time, let him come into no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Poults of Mallowes, &amp;c. muſt be every night applyed till he be whole. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take (and to conclude) blew ſlate and brimſtone, of each four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Verdigreaſe one ounce, made into fine powder, then take freſh butter four pound, melt it in a ſmall kettle or Poſnet, and ſo ſoon as the butter is molten, put into it all the former ingredients, and ſo let them boyle wel; and when you have brought it to a perfect unguent, take it off, and keep it for your uſe. And when you would uſe it, warm thereof upon a chafing diſh and coles, and annoynt your Horſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon the ſorance, and that but once, and it will ſuffice. But you muſt let him <hi>bloud</hi> the day before you doe annoint him in the <hi>necke veine.</hi> And at the end of eight dayes, take a quantity of cold Lee, and three ounces of blacke ſope, and waſh the ſorance therewith. This quantity of oyntment will ſerve but onely for two Horſes. Of this Receit I never had occaſion to make tryall; but it was taught me by a famous <hi>Mariſhall</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who commended it unto me for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good Receit; and truely it ſeemes to me ſo to be.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Take the leafe of the hearb called Saubſucus,<note place="margin">Caſt in a Halter.</note> ſtamp it and ſtrayn it, and take only the juyce thereof, and apply the ſaid juyce to the ſorance by waſhing it therewith, after take a linnen cloth, white and cleane, and make it into three or foure folds, ſteeping the cloath in the ſaid juyce, and bind it on to the place grieved: but in Winter when the ſaid Leafe is not to be had, you muſt take the ſecond rinde thereof, and do therewith as before; but then note, that before you waſh and apply the ſaide juyce to the wound, you muſt firſt waſh the ſorance with warme Water, and then apply your ſaid juyce, and he ſhalbe perfectly cured in ſhort time. This I never yet experienced, by reaſon I could never yet meete with the Hearb.

                        <hi>Cauterization</hi> or giving of fire is of two natures, <hi>viz. Actuall</hi> and <hi>Potentiall:</hi> your <hi>Cautery actuall</hi> is made by hot bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inſtruments, with which you ſeare and burn thoſe places which be requiſite for the perfecting of the Cure you have in hand, which cannot be peradventure otherwiſe well cured, but by giving of the fire: as in caſe of great impoſtumations, ſtanching of <hi>bloud</hi> in wounds, or in ſearing of <hi>veines, ſinewes,</hi> or the like: or elſe in caſe of diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, if other meanes be not at hand, whereby to ſtay the flux of <hi>bloud</hi> without danger of bleeding to death, and ſo likewiſe in very many caſes of this nature, wherein I doe adviſe all men that are not very perfect in giving the fire, that they doe not practiſe upon Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of price,<note place="margin">Cautery actuall.</note> but firſt upon Iades, and low-prized Horſes, to the end they may the better come to know how to carry their hand, and to underſtand themſelves in this Art the better: as when they are to uſe the lighter, and when the heavier hand; as alſo that they do make their circles round, and their lines ſtreight and even, and not crooked
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7066:72"/> or waving. For this <hi>actuall fire</hi> is a thing moſt neceſſary for them that doe truely know and underſtand the true uſe and vertue thereof, and therefore it ought to be very carefully, judiciouſly, and moderately applyed, and never but upon good and very conſiderate grounds: which in ſo doing, you ſhall finde it to be a moſt ſoveraigne remedy to hinder and ſtay all manner of corruption whereunto any member may be enclined, provided that in the handling of your inſtrument, you touch not <hi>Muſcles, Arteries, Sinewes, Ligaments, Cords,</hi> or the like, for ſo you may utterly lame where you would ſet upright, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy where you would cure, excepting onely in caſes needfull. For by applying this <hi>actuall fire,</hi> you ſhall joyne and conglutinate parts and <hi>members</hi> ſevered, dry up ſuperfluous moyſture, and ſinke <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> ſwelled: you ſhall beſides bring forth all evill and putrifactious matter congealed and gathered into knots, as Wens, Biles, Puſtils, Exulcerations, and the like: you ſhall alſo aſſwage old griefes, and make perfect all ſuch parts of the <hi>body</hi> as be any way corrupted: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall you need feare the increaſe of any evill <hi>humours,</hi> by reaſon that the <hi>skin</hi> being ſevered by meanes of the hot iron, it doth ripen and digeſt all manner of putrifaction and matrative ſtuffe, whereby it venteth and paſſeth away much more eaſily, healing and qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all griefe and paine, cauſing the <hi>member</hi> which before was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to feſtring and to gangrene, to become the ſounder, and by much the ſtronger, ſo as nothing of diſadvantage will be remaining, but the <hi>ſcar</hi> onely, where the iron paſſed, and the worſt that can be made thereof, will be but a little <hi>eye-ſore.</hi> But then you muſt have a very great regard unto your Inſtruments that they be made according to the nature and quality of the place and <hi>member</hi> which is to be ſeared: for one faſhion will not ſerve in all cauſes; for as the places which are to be <hi>cauterized</hi> are commonly different in ſhape and proportion, ſo alſo ought the ſhapes and faſhions of your inſtruments to be made accordingly. You are alſo to have a ſpeciall care to the heating of your inſtruments, which ought to be done with a right good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for as they muſt not be too cold, ſo ought they not to be too hot, for by that meanes you may eaſily enflame the <hi>cauterized</hi> places too much: Againe, in giving the fire great care muſt be had to the bearing of the hand, for therein conſiſteth very great cunning, and as I have before admoniſhed you to be carefull that you touch not any <hi>ſinew</hi> or <hi>ligament,</hi> ſo no fire is to be given to the diſlocation or fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any bone.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7066:73"/> its once received heat longer than any other <hi>mettle,</hi> whereby I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo much deceived in my work; for <hi>gold, ſilver,</hi> and <hi>braſſe,</hi> as they be ſooner made hot than <hi>iron</hi> or <hi>ſteele,</hi> ſo are they as ſoone cold: now <hi>ſteele</hi> and <hi>iron</hi> mettals are much more ſubſtantiall and harder of nature then the other <hi>mettals</hi> be, and therefore as they are ſomewhat longer before they be hot, ſo they retaine their heat much longer, which during the time of their agitation, workes more ſurely: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, a man cannot tell when thoſe other mettals are hot enough, as alſo when they be too hot, if you put never ſo little water to them whereby to allay their over-much heat, they ſuddenly turne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo cold as not to be able to make them worke at all; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof you ſhall finde to be in the nature of <hi>iron</hi> and <hi>ſteele.</hi> And let this ſuffice for <hi>cautery actuall.</hi> Now I will in a word handle <hi>cautery potentiall,</hi>

                     <p>Take Sheepes-ſuet, or Deeres-ſuet which is much better, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing molten upon the fire, let it coole till you may hold your finger therein; then put to it ſo much Ry-bran; or (for want thereof) Wheate-bran as will bring it to a ſalve, lay it to the place Plaiſter-wiſe upon Hurds or Tow, and binde a cleane linnen cloath over the Plaiſter to keepe it on, and ſo let it remaine foure or five daies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out medling with it, by which time the Sores wilbe throughly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the ſcurfe will eaſily come off; then take old Bores greaſe well rotted, and melt it upon the fire, and when it is ſo cold as was the Sheepes, or Deere-ſewet, put to it the yolkes of Egges ſo much as will ſuffice, and a little Verdegreaſe in fine powder: incorporate all theſe well together, bringing them to an Vnguent, with which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy at the ſores every day once, untill they bee throughly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly whole. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>.

                        <hi>humours,</hi> which doe cumber, peſter, and diſturb the <hi>body</hi> with their peccant condition: affirming that ſuch ill <hi>humours</hi> do breed much bad nutriment, which the learned doe call <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> which when it will not be corrected or amended, either by faire meanes, or by the help of nature, then muſt it be compelled, forced, and driven away by <hi>Purgation, Vomit, Cliſter,</hi> or <hi>Suppoſitory.</hi> And whereas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Blundevile</hi> ſaith, that Horſes are not uſed to be purged by <hi>Vomit,</hi> as men be; I in conference with him once asked him the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; he anſwered me, for that the necke of the Horſe was of that length, as not to be able to purge by <hi>vomit,</hi> which for the preſent I tooke for ſatisfaction; I then imagining the thing not to be knowne, untill ſuch time as I travelling into remote parts, where I had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent commerce with famous <hi>Mariſhals</hi> and <hi>Ferriers,</hi> I at length faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon one eminent for his faculty, who upon occaſion offered, uſed to adminiſter <hi>vomit</hi> to Horſes as frequently as he did either <hi>Purgation</hi> or <hi>Clyſter:</hi> which thing when I well obſerved, I deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if a Horſe could <hi>vomit,</hi> and to what purpoſe he did adminiſter in that kinde; he anſwered me that a Horſe could <hi>vomit,</hi> and that he oft times adminiſtred for the ſame end, and thereupon both gave me his Receit, and did adminiſter in my preſence, and made me an <hi>eye-witneſſe</hi> to the working, not in one Horſe alone, but in ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                        </gap>rpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of bad <hi>humours,</hi> to cleanſe ulcers, to aſſwage the griefes and paines in the <hi>belly</hi> cauſed by winde or otherwiſe, and ſo likewiſe in many other caſes. Now <hi>Clyſters</hi> are not all of one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither are they all <hi>laxatives</hi> (as many doe imagine) or do ſerve to one and the ſame end: for ſome muſt be made to give eaſe, ſome are <hi>reſtringent,</hi> and doe binde, ſome do looſen and <hi>purge,</hi> ſome are to cleanſe <hi>ulcers,</hi> old and long running ſores, and ſome to prepare the <hi>body</hi> the better to receive its <hi>Phyſicke,</hi> whereby it may the better worke, which otherwiſe cannot be adminiſtred without much perill to the life of the ſicke creature. So that a <hi>Clyſter</hi> is (I ſay) commonly given for a <hi>Preparative</hi> or beginning to <hi>purgation.</hi> And a <hi>Clyſter</hi> by cleanſing the <hi>guts,</hi> refreſheth the <hi>vitall parts,</hi> and prepareth the way before. Wherefore I doe admoniſh every <hi>Ferrier,</hi> that when at any time they are to adminiſter <hi>Phyſicke</hi> to a Horſe, whether <hi>Purgative</hi> or otherwiſe, if the Horſe be not at the time ſoluble in <hi>body,</hi> that after <hi>bloud-letting</hi> the next day he give a <hi>Clyſter,</hi> and then may he be the

                     <p>Take a Hens egge, and make a hole in the top thereof, no bigger than that you may get forth the white and yolke: Then take Tarre and ſweet Butter, of each like much, as much as will ſuffice, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate theſe well together into one body, and ſo convey it into the egge ſhell, and give it your Horſe three or foure mornings together, and either journey him gently, or elſe ride him three or foure houres after it; which done, bring him into the Stable and cloath him up warme, and litter him well, and let him be well rubbed, and ſo keep him upon the trench two houres after, and then give him Hay, and an houre after give him either a warme Maſh, or white water; and this will help a cold newly taken. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This will not make him ſicke, for I have often made tryall of it.

The firſt of theſe two, to wit, the <hi>Simple,</hi> is of moſt excellent uſe, for it helpeth any ordinary cold or ſtopping, it comforteth the <hi>Lunges,</hi> enlargeth his <hi>Winde,</hi> purgeth the <hi>Head</hi> from all filthy matter, and diſſolveth many other obſtructions, as well in the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Head.</hi> But the <hi>Compound</hi> or <hi>Conſerve</hi> worketh better effects in the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> eſpecially if the Malady be old and dangerous, or if there be any taint, in the <hi>Lunges, Liver,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts: This <hi>Conſerve</hi> in time, by frequent uſe thereof will cure all dry Coughs which are held to be incurable, it helpeth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the <hi>Belly</hi> and <hi>Flankes,</hi> it cauſeth the <hi>Horſe</hi> to take his <hi>Wind</hi> kindly and temperately, and freeth him of his dry Cough which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did greatly annoy him; but if you have not theſe <hi>conſerves,</hi> take this other Receipt little inferiour to the former for theſe Maladies.</p>

But if your <hi>horſe</hi> have an inward cold, which lyeth lurking in his <hi>Lunges</hi> or <hi>Stomacke,</hi> then give him this Medicine.</p>

You muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the boyled Branne is that which dryeth up all his groſſe and corrupt <hi>humours,</hi> which was the cauſe of his cold. Now the powder is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of Comen-ſeed, Fenugrick, Silleris-Montani (<hi>alias</hi> Siſileos) Nutmegs, Cloves, Ginger, Linſeed, of each two ounces, Quick Brimſtone ſixe ounces, make all theſe into fine powder, and let them be well mixed: this muſt be given with his Oates, as is before inculcated; but he muſt firſt be watered; and then preſently let him be well rubbed, <hi>body, necke, pole, legges, breaſt</hi> and <hi>belly,</hi> and cloathed and littered warme, and an houre before you give him his Oates, put into his Rack a little ſweet wheat ſtraw, and ſo (I ſay) let him eate thereof the ſpace of one houre or better, and then give him his Oates mixed with this powder, which having eaten, give him Hay at your pleaſure; and thus doing in ſhort time you ſhall perceive his Cold to be quite gone, and the ſooner if he ſhall be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ayered an houre after Sun-riſing, and an houre before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, if the Sunne doe ſhine. Now if this Cold bring with it a violent cough, as is often ſeen, then give him the aforeſaid Wheat Branne boyled, together with the ſaid powder with his Oates, but then not above three or foure dayes, for that the ſaid powder diſperſeth the corrupt and groſſe <hi>humours</hi> that are in the <hi>body,</hi> which doe occaſion the ſaid cough, and when you doe perceive that he hath purged ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, keep him notwithſtanding to his white water, but an houre before you doe water him;</p>

                     <p>Take two new laid Egges, and open the crownes, and get forth ſome of the white, and then put into theſe Egges ſo much of the powder of Brimſtone as you can take up upon a ſhilling into either Egge: give him this every morning for ſome time, or till you ſee the cough to goe from him.

                     <p>Take Iſope, Anniſeeds, Licoris, Graines, Long Pepper, Gentiana, Elecampane dried, of each three drams, make all the ſpices into fine powder, and ſtamp the Iſope well, and ſo put all into good Sack one pinte, and of good Ale alſo one pinte, and of Honey one ſpoonfull, and ſo boyle it, and give it your Horſe bloud-warme, and ſet him up, and cloth him, and litter him warme, cauſing him to faſt three houres after it, and give him no cold water, but ſweet Maſhes or white water; and this will cure him, for it is an approved good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another very good.</p>
                     <p>Take Wheate meale, Anniſeeds, Licoris, Polipodium of the Oake dryed, Elecampane dryed: make all theſe into powder, and mixe them well: Take two ſpoonfuls of this powder, with a head of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke pilled and bruized, mixe all theſe well together, and with your Wheate meale and honey as much as will ſuffice, make pils thereof to the bigneſſe of a great Walnut, and give your Horſe every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning three or foure of theſe Pils, and ſo ſoone as he hath taken them, give him two new laid Egges with their ſhels.

                     <p>Take Benjamin and Brimſtone made into very fine powder, of each halfe an ounce, give this your Horſe with one pinte of Muskadine, putting into it two new laid Egges ſhels and all, broken and well beaten together, let it be given three mornings together. This was commended unto me for a ſpeciall good Receit, but I never did make tryall thereof. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take Nettle-ſeeds, Anniſeeds, Reyſins of the ſunne ſtoned, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campane in fine powder, of each halfe an ounce, make all the ſpices and ſeeds into very fine powder, and cut the Reyſins very ſmall, and ſo boyle all theſe in Muskadine or Sacke a quart, with three ſpoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of life Honey, then ſtraine it, and give it him three mornings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether bloud-warme.

Now if his cough be ſo violent as that it may endanger his <hi>winde;</hi> then,</p>
                     <p>Take Calamint, Gentiana, Comin-ſeed, Licoris, Elecampane, of each two drams, make all theſe into fine powder, and confect them with life Honey and Butter mingled together and molten; and when it is cold, make it up into Pils; then rowle them in the powder of Anniſeeds, and give him of theſe Pils three or foure every morning, for two or three mornings together faſting, and after keep him warm, and let his drinke be Maſhes or White-water. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>.

                     <p>Sir, as touching this infirmity, I ſay there is none ſuch, for you muſt underſtand that this diſeaſe ſo vulgarly called a <hi>broken wind,</hi> is truely a ſhortneſſe of breath, or a taint or defect in the <hi>winde,</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſſe, the Asmat or Purtiſick, as Artiſts doe call it. Three cauſes there be of this infirmity, two whereof proceed from a cold former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, and the third from another cauſe, as ſhall preſently be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. The firſt is an exulceration of the lungs, which doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from a cold; the ſecond by clinging and growing together of the <hi>lights,</hi> whoſe origen came alſo of cold; and the third is a diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>lungs,</hi> and this laſt commeth by meanes of ſome violent or ſudden act or motion of the body, or by ſome fall whereby the <hi>lungs</hi> were become diſlocated, diſplaced, or turned in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> every of which doe occaſion <hi>ſhortneſſe of breath,</hi> by reaſon the lungs have not power ſufficient (being the bellowes of the body) to open, ſhut, and play at pleaſure; and this is the cauſe why the Horſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth at the <hi>ribs</hi> and <hi>flankes,</hi> fetcheth his breath ſhort and hot at the <hi>noſe,</hi> wheeſeth, and oft times reeleth when he is put to little that doth ſtraine his <hi>winde,</hi> and therefore ſo long as he is kept in the ſtable at dry and hard meats, he heaveth more then when he is at graſſe, for if you doe waſh his Provender in Ale or Beere, and ſprinkle his Hay
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7066:85"/> with water, you ſhall perceive him to heave the leſſe: but when he runneth at graſſe, he heaveth ſo little, as hardly to be ſeen, and the reaſon is, for that the <hi>Horſe</hi> having naturally a very moyſt body, the cold which he hath taken doth ſo condenſe and make thicke thoſe <hi>humours</hi> which before were thinne, which doe (whilſt they were <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues</hi>) paſſe moſt eaſily through the pores, but now they are become thick, viſcous, and ſlimy, ſtopping the pores in ſuch ſort, as hardly to be able to <hi>breath,</hi> but with great labour and no leſſe paine, which doth provoke him to heave and lift, by reaſon that the <hi>lungs, pores,</hi> and <hi>pipes</hi> are ſo ſtopped and oppreſt, as not to be able to performe their function and naturall office, for which nature hath created them, and beſides thoſe ſtoppings doe conſtraine him to cough and labour ſo extreamely, as to endanger oft times the breaking of a <hi>veyne,</hi> from whence enſue many more inconveniences then this one: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you may have meanes to help his <hi>winde,</hi> but to recover him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſound againe, I dare not abſolutely promiſe you, and if you be ſolicitous to underſtand more of this ſubject, to ſave both your owne labour and mine, if you will be pleaſed to peruſe Maſter <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devile</hi> and Maſter <hi>Markham,</hi> they are able to give you ample ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>

The ſignes to know it are theſe; his <hi>belly</hi> will be gaunt,<note place="margin">Dry Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> and he will be Hide-bound, his <hi>fleſh</hi> will conſume almoſt to <hi>skinne</hi> and <hi>bones,</hi> if you ſtrike him on the <hi>belly,</hi> it will ſound hollow, his <hi>haire</hi> will ſtare, neither will he caſt it in due ſeaſon, when other <hi>Horſes</hi> which be ſound will doe, he will cough hollow and faintly: the <hi>Horſe</hi> that is troubled with this diſeaſe, well may he be kept for ſome time alive, but long he cannot be, for the malady is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, if it be too long let runne, and therefore I leave him to Dogs and Crowes in his languiſhing plight. The other <hi>conſumption</hi> is that of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> which alſo beginneth of a cold formerly taken, which for want of remedy in time, occaſioneth a generall diſlike and macerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on throughout the whole body: it commeth from immoderate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or travell by violent heat and cold taken upon it: it commeth alſo by riding him into the water after a great heat given, and then
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7066:85"/> ſet up preſently negligently; as once it hapned to a young <hi>Nagge</hi> of good mettell and ſpirit, and of very great hope, the owner of which <hi>Nagge</hi> delivered him to an <hi>Ambler</hi> to pace, who whilſt he had him in agitation, hearing Hounds abroad made in to them, who rodde him hard all day to the death of the Hare, then comming home hot and all in a ſweat, neere to the <hi>Amblers</hi> Houſe was a River with a Water-Mill, where he ſet him up to the skirts of the Saddle, &amp; then brought him into the Stable where was neyther cloath, litter, or other thing to keepe him warme, or wherewith to rub him, at which time hee tooke ſo deſperate a cold as never after to be cured: for in ſhort time after, he brought him to the <hi>Gentleman</hi> that did owne him, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his comming home the <hi>Nagge</hi> drooped, forſooke his meate, and became very ſick; the <hi>Gentleman</hi> deſired me to endeavour the beſt I might for his recovery, for that he loved the <hi>Nagge</hi> well. I ignorant of the cauſe of his Malady, went as I thought according to Art, I tooke <hi>bloud</hi> from ſundry <hi>veines,</hi> I gave him a <hi>Suppoſitory,</hi> and after certaine <hi>Clyſters,</hi> which I aſſured me were moſt needfull for him,<note place="margin">Conſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that all ſickneſſe commeth either by heates in over violent exerciſe, as when the Horſe <hi>(v. g.)</hi> hath his greaſe molten, the <hi>heart</hi> overchaged, the <hi>vitall bloud</hi> forced from the inward parts, and the large <hi>Pores</hi> and <hi>Orifices</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> ſo obſtructed, and ſtopped, that the <hi>ſpirits</hi> cannot returne backe to their proper places, ſo as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the <hi>Body</hi> cannot rejoyce, but by this meanes the <hi>body</hi> muſt of neceſſity languiſh, founder, and mortifie.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, dangerous ſickneſſe commeth alſo by colds, as by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreete or negligent keeping, as well before as after long and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exerciſe, and then is the <hi>head</hi> perplexed, the <hi>eyes</hi> dulled, and pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the rootes of the <hi>tongue</hi> inflamed and ſwelled, the <hi>lunges</hi> with rhumes tickled and offended, occaſioning ſtrong, and laborious coughing, and the <hi>Noſthrills</hi> often diſtilling and powring forth filthy and corrupt matter.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, dangerous ſickneſſe commeth alſo by ſurfet of foode, either by eating too much, or too little of what is good, or alſo of that which is not wholeſome, ſo as the firſt killeth, or at leaſt debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth the <hi>Stomacke,</hi> oppreſſeth the <hi>Heart,</hi> and ſendeth up thoſe evill fumes into the <hi>Head</hi> by which are ingendred the Stavars, Frenzies, and other mortall diſeaſes, the ſecond putrifies the <hi>bloud,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts all its nutriment into corruption, from whence proceedes the Yellows, Farcin, Feavers, Mainges, and other ſuch like peſtilent, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous and loathſome diſeaſes, which ſuffocating the <hi>heart,</hi> and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the <hi>Stomacke,</hi> dilates and ſpreads it ſelfe univerſally over the whole <hi>body,</hi> leaving no <hi>member</hi> free, and confoundeth every <hi>faculty,</hi> and <hi>member</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, dangerous ſickneſſe comes alſo by <hi>accident,</hi>

                     <p>Very eaſily Sir, for if ſickneſſe doth proceed from the firſt of theſe foure principles, to wit from heats, then are the ſignes theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The heavineſſe of his countenance, ſwelling of his limbs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of his hinder legges, ſcowring and looſeneſſe of his body, in the beginning of ſickneſſe ſhort, and hot breath, a loathing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of meat, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If from the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> cold, then the ſignes are, a dejected <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> dulneſſe or ſleepineſſe of the <hi>eyes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dangerous ſickneſſe how to know</note> Puſtils or hard knots under the <hi>Chaule,</hi> yea and many times inflamed kernels and ſwellings ſo high as to the very roots of the <hi>eares,</hi> a rotten or moyſt inward hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low cough, he many times chewing betwivt his teeth, ſome looſe, filthy, and flegmaticke matter, immediately after his coughing, which in ſome caſes is not an evill ſigne by reaſon that thereby the cold rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and goeth away; whereas on the contrary ſide for a <hi>Horſe</hi> to cough cleare and dry, doth demonſtrate a dry cough, which hath long time lurked in his <hi>body,</hi> ſorely feſtring and tormenting him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, which is very difficile to cure, but at length diſcovers it ſelfe by reaſon the <hi>creatures</hi> languiſhing, and generall falling away of his <hi>fleſh,</hi> for his <hi>belly</hi> will be ſhrunke up, and when he drinketh much of the ſame, water will iſſue forth of his <hi>noſe,</hi> his <hi>eyes</hi> will be either wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or materative, and runne continually through paine which he hath in his <hi>head,</hi> procured by meanes of this cold, and his <hi>hayre</hi> will be rough and ſtaring, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From the third, to wit from ſurfet by meate, either naturall or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the ſignes be theſe, a dulneſſe of the <hi>head, eyes,</hi> and <hi>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> yea and that in ſuch a violent manner, ſo as the <hi>Horſe</hi> will be hardly able to lift up his <hi>head</hi> from the manger, a dull and dead <hi>eye,</hi> and ſunk into his <hi>head,</hi> his <hi>eares</hi> prickt upright, and the tops of them cold, as alſo his upper <hi>lips</hi> and <hi>ſheath,</hi> his pace reeling and ſtaggering, and (if the diſeaſe be farre gone) he will be of a frenetike and mad comportment, as by biting and gnawing the Racke and Manger, or whomſoever ſhall come within his reach, and ſometimes by biting of himſelfe, and by beating his <hi>head</hi> againſt the wall and floore, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7066:90"/> other ſuch franticke poſtures and paſſions: but if the malady be not yet gotten into the <hi>braine,</hi> or doe not occupy that place; but that it hath ſettled it ſelfe more intrinſecally in the <hi>body</hi> or <hi>heart,</hi> then you ſhall perceive by the whites of the <hi>eyes,</hi> the <hi>lips</hi> and <hi>tongue,</hi> this diſeaſe to be the plaine yellowes, and if the diſeaſe be farre gone, then will the Yellowes be diſperſed all over the whole <hi>skinne,</hi> and the <hi>Horſe</hi> ſweat in the morning when firſt you come to him, as if he had beene ſorely ridden, or had an <hi>Arcticke feaver,</hi> and have a deſire rather to be lying then to ſtand, and when he ſtandeth, it will be with his <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs</hi> ſtraddling the one from the other, and he will alſo have a looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſcowring, eſpecially if the <hi>Horſe</hi> hath taken his ſurfet by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too many Oates, or other provender, and by drinking ſudden-after, which you ſhall the better know, becauſe the <hi>Horſe</hi> will in his <hi>ordure</hi> voyd ſome of his Oates or other graine whole, as not being diſgeſted, by reaſon that the cold water ſo ſuddenly taken, upon his over-haſty eating (not being all chewed) will coole his <hi>ſtomacke,</hi> and make him to ſwell: beſides the <hi>Horſe</hi> will have a generall loathing and forſaking of his meat, which is likewiſe the common ſymptome of every kinde of ſurfet, and almoſt every degree of ſickneſſe.</p>
                     <p> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth and laſt ground or principle is, that if his infirmity and ſickneſſe doe proceed from <hi>accidentall</hi> meanes, then are the ſignes, a perplexed and troubled <hi>body,</hi> ſometimes ſweating at the roots of his <hi>eares,</hi> in the <hi>flankes,</hi> and behinde the <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> againſt the <hi>heart,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he will be taken with a trembling all his <hi>body</hi> over, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a glowing and burning in his <hi>vitall parts,</hi> as in the <hi>temples</hi> of his <hi>head</hi> againſt his <hi>heart,</hi> on the inſide of his <hi>fore-legs</hi> next to the <hi>body,</hi> and on the inſide of the <hi>hinder-legs,</hi> alſo his mouth will be dry and hot, his <hi>tongue</hi> will be ſubject to be enflamed and furred; in fine he will have a loathing and averſion from meat; but onely that he muſt eate, and a great draught and thirſt, and a great longing to drink cold water, and when he hath drunke what him liketh, yet will he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe deſire to keep his mouth continually in the water. Many other ſignes there be, whereby a man who is any thing at all skilfull and cautelous, may by obſerving, diſcover when his <hi>Horſe</hi> falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any infirmity and ſickneſſe, as when you doe perceive that his countenance and poſtures do alter from their uſuall cuſtomes, then be you well aſſured, your <hi>Horſe</hi> doth alter and decay in his health. Alſo you muſt obſerve his feeding, and how he doth eate, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a good <hi>appetite,</hi> or with a weake <hi>ſtomacke,</hi> the firſt being good, the ſecond unkindely and unhealthy, as alſo how he doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge or empty himſelfe, and how his <hi>urine</hi> and the colour of his <hi>doung</hi> or <hi>ordure</hi> doe alter, which if his <hi>doung</hi> or <hi>excrements</hi> be pale, and full of graines, then is it good, but if blacklſh and dusky (according as I have before in its due place handled) then be you confident, he hath much heate and dryneſſe in his <hi>body,</hi> by which meanes probably enſueth great and dangerous ſickneſſe: very many other ſigns of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7066:90"/> there are, as the not caſting or ſhedding of his hayre, in its due and proper ſeaſon, <hi>hide bound,</hi> coſtiveneſſe, laxativeneſſe, the cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of his <hi>belly</hi> to the <hi>flankes,</hi> continuall diſlike, drowſineſſe, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and heavineſſe, when he hath wanted due ordering and feeding, &amp;c. all which ſymptomes are ſo well known to every man, as that they need not be handled further in this place.</p>

                     <p>Truely Sir, both my Maſter and my ſelfe have done ſuch cures upon <hi>Horſes,</hi> which have beene ſo deſperately ſick as you ſpeak of; inſomuch as the beholders have pronounced ſentence of death upon them, and the owners would have beene well content to have beene ſatisfied, and well appayed with their skinnes and ſhooes, and I will ſhew you what our cure is.</p>
                     <p>Firſt open the neck veine, and let him bleed well, then two houres after his bleeding,</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Diateſſeron</hi> halfe an ounce, and give it him bloud warme in Muskadine a pint,<note place="margin">Deſperate ſickneſſe.</note> or Sack, for want thereof, or elſe if theſe be not on the ſuddaine to be gotten, then take good Ale or Beere, with the like quantity of <hi>Diateſſeron,</hi> then having given it, walke him halfe an houre (if he be able) in the warme Sunne, or if there be not Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, then in ſome warme Stable, or Barne, then ſet him up warme cloathed, and littered, and let him be rubbed all over, as <hi>Head, Pole, Neck,</hi> and <hi>Legges,</hi> and eſpecially twixt the <hi>Eares,</hi> for that greatly ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the payne in the <hi>head,</hi> by reaſon it diſſolveth and diſperſeth the <hi>humors:</hi> at noone unbridle him, and offer him a little ſweet Hay, ſprinkled with water, which if he ſhall refuſe to eate, (as tis likely he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7066:93"/> will) then offer him ſo much bread as the quantity of a penny loafe, and let him eate it all if he will, but if he do refuſe to eate thereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, then give him one gallon of the ſtrongeſt Ale-wort you can get of the firſt runnings ſo ſoon as it is maſhed, but let it not be over-hot, and before barme be put unto it, give him this I ſay bloud warm, but if that cannot be gotten, then provide him in a readineſſe againſt the ſame houre, a ſweet Maſh, which when he hath taken, fume his head with Olibanum, Storax, and Benjamin, and then let him be rubbed againe as before, and ſee him warme kept as is uſuall for ſicke <hi>Horſes</hi> in <hi>phyſicke:</hi> and thus doe for three dayes together in all poynts (<hi>bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting</hi> excepted) for that muſt be once onely (unleſſe extraordinary cauſe doe require the ſame) and aſſure your ſelfe your <hi>Horſe</hi> will mend daily, and recover his health and ſtrength in ſhort time, and at three dayes end, give him no more Maſhes, but in their ſtead, let him have white water onely: if by meanes of this ſickneſſe he hath any Puſtils or inflamations riſen under his <hi>chaule,</hi> then clip away the <hi>hayre,</hi> and apply ſuch things thereunto, as may ripen them and bring them to a head; and after breake them with Shoomakers waxe, or other ſuch like good things, and ſo let them runne and heale at pleaſure. Alſo if you doe finde your <hi>Horſe</hi> to be coſtive by meanes of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as commonly <hi>horſes</hi> will be after Phyſicke, then firſt rake him, and finding his doung to be hot, dry, and hard, give him the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory of a candle, ſhewed you in chap. 18. § 27.

                     <p>Take of new milke one quart, and put to it of Beane flower two ſpoonfuls, and as much of the powder of Bolearmonack ſearſed, boyle theſe untill the milke thicken, and ſo bloud warme give it your <hi>Horſe,</hi> and in a morning or two faſting with a horne, and it will ſtay his looſeneſſe: <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> but if this doe it not, then ſhall you</p>

                     <p>Take of <hi>Dragon-water</hi> one pinte, <hi>London Treacle</hi> one ounce, warme it till the Treacle be diſſolved, and ſo give it him bloud warm; give him this drinke three mornings together, and for his drink other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let him have ſweet Maſhes three mornings onely, and after till he be well recovered, let him have no cold water by any meanes, but

                     <p>This diſeaſe hath an apparant ground more then conjecturall, for it never commeth to be knowne by any ſymptomes, but onely when the <hi>horſe</hi> falleth into diſlike, and loſeth the true and perfect colour of his hayre and skinne, and when he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his <hi>ſpirit, mettle, ſtrength, cheerefulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſtomacke,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee it commeth principally for want of good nouriſhment and digeſture, which paſſeth into melancholy, it proceeding either from the <hi>ſpleene,</hi> or from the <hi>liver,</hi> or both, the <hi>bloud</hi> being corrupted, and converted into a thin and watry ſubſtance, and ſometimes it commeth of over-much reſt, for want of moderate exerciſe, which I doe judge to be the more probable. Some <hi>Ferriers</hi> doe affirme that there be three kindes of this diſeaſe, but I could never obſerve more then one only, which hath its origen either of <hi>melancholy bloud water,</hi> or <hi>winde,</hi> but chiefly of water, by reaſon that the <hi>belly</hi> &amp; <hi>legs</hi> of a <hi>horſe</hi> will ſwell, and that a <hi>watry humour</hi> runnes 'twixt the <hi>skin</hi> and the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and if you lay your finger hard upon the ſwolne places, when you ſhall take it away, there will be in the place a pit for a ſmall time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ſignes to know it are, that he will be ſwelled both <hi>body</hi> and <hi>legges,</hi> he will be alſo ſhort-breathed, loſe his <hi>ſtomacke,</hi> have in his <hi>body</hi> a continuall drought, but yet when he commeth to drinke, he will not drinke much, but pudder long with his <hi>noſe</hi> in the water, he will be as if he had a generall conſumption over all his <hi>body,</hi> and in time he will pine and fall away to the very <hi>bones,</hi> and his <hi>flankes</hi> and <hi>buttockes</hi> will be dry, and his <hi>hayre</hi> will ſhed and pill off with every rubbing, &amp;c. The cure is, firſt let him <hi>bloud,</hi> to take away the cold,<note place="margin">Dropſie.</note> thin watriſh or wheyiſh <hi>bloud,</hi> that better may come in its place, then cover him warme, and give him a ſweat in the Stable, but if he will not be brought to ſweat in the Stable (as many times it ſo falleth out) then exerciſe him abroad till he ſweat, and bring him into the Stable againe, and cloath and litter him warm, and let him be well rubbed, and give him Sallow leaves, or the leaves of the Elme tree greene, Rye blades, Sedge, or Graſſe, to keep his <hi>body</hi> open, and when you doe give him Hay, let it be ſprinckled with water; then give him this drinke:</p>
                     <p>Take of Ale one gallon, ſet it upon the fire, and ſcum off the froth as it riſeth, then put into it of Worm-wood, and of Rue the tender tops and leaves without ſtalkes carefully picked, of each a handfull,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7066:95"/> and ſo boyle the Ale to a quart, then take it off, and ſtraine it well, and diſſolve into it of the beſt <hi>London</hi> Treacle three ounces, and put alſo unto it of long-Pepper and Grains both made into fine powder, of each one ounce, then brew all theſe well together till it be but bloud warme, and ſo give it him to drinke, then bathe and annoynt the legs that be ſwelled with Trayne-oyle twice a day, till the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling goe away; and give him Maſhes or white water, and feed him with ſuch meate as he will beſt eate, changing his dyet daily, and give it him by little at once, and after ſome ſmall time thus ſpent with him, if the weather be ſeaſonable, turne him to graſſe, and he ſhall doe well and become ſound againe. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is all the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie I doe know, howſoever many <hi>Ferriers</hi> doe talke much of another kinde which they doe call the <hi>Feltrick,</hi> which is not truely a Dropſie, but a diſeaſe diſtinct from the Dropſie, unto which young <hi>Horſes</hi> are inclinable, that from <hi>Foles</hi> and <hi>Colts</hi> are bred in Fennes, Moores, Marſhes, moyſt and wet grounds, and Commons, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will ſwell exceedingly under the <hi>belly,</hi> and ſo ſoone as they doe come to be handled and backed, whereby they may be provoked to ſweate, they will preſently have inflamations under the <hi>Chaule,</hi> runne at <hi>noſe,</hi> fall into an incurable Glanders, and in a word become inwardly rotten, The cure is,</p>

                     <p>Aſſuredly Sir the diſeaſes of the <hi>Liver</hi> are many, but yet the true and certaine grounds, how to diſcover them is beyond eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Ferriers</hi> skill to compaſſe; nevertheleſſe that there be many, and thoſe ſeverall and diſtinct Infirmities in the <hi>Liver,</hi> no man needes make doubt: for if the <hi>Liver</hi> be eyther too hot, or too dry, too moiſt, or too cold, may eaſily be diſeaſed, which muſt needs occurre to the <hi>Horſe,</hi> eyther by intemperate riding or labour, or by evill foode, or by meanes of evill and corrupt <hi>humors,</hi> which do gather to the place, or by the overflowing of the <hi>Gall,</hi> or when <hi>Choler</hi> is predominate, it being cheifly ingendred through heat, like as cold begetteth <hi>Flegme,</hi> which cauſeth the ſickneſſe and ill diſpoſition of the <hi>Liver,</hi> together with its payne and anguiſh, whence proceede inflamations, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumations, ſtoppings, obſtructions, knobs, yea and very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vlcers, every of which do cauſe the generall Conſumption and diſeaſe thereof. If the diſeaſe of the <hi>Liver</hi> do proceed from any hot cauſe, it is more eaſie to bee diſcovered, then if it came from any cold cauſe, for that it doth diſcover it ſelfe by theſe apparant ſignes <hi>viz.</hi> He will bee leane and fall away of his <hi>fleſh,</hi> hee will loath his meate, and that which he eateth doth him little or no good, for want of ready digeſtion, his <hi>ordure</hi> wilbe very offenſive, his thirſt great, and he will be verv much ſubject to a looſeneſſe: whereas on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, if the diſeaſe ariſeth from any cold cauſe, you cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it bv any of theſe ſignes, for that he will be in very good liking &amp; ſtate of <hi>body,</hi> eate his meat with a good appetite, his <hi>excrements</hi> will

Now if a <hi>Horſe</hi> be diſeaſed in his <hi>liver,</hi> the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity muſt (I ſay) proceed from an inflamation and impoſtumation, or from an ulcer. If it come from a cold cauſe, it cannot be an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, nor an impoſtumation, for that theſe two doe both come from a hot cauſe, as all the learned doe know full well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceſſity it muſt be an <hi>ulcer</hi> which proceedeth from a cold cauſe, and the ſignes to know it is, continuall coldneſſe of his <hi>body,</hi> his <hi>hayre</hi> will ſtare, and he will be ſubject to great feebleneſſe, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and debility of <hi>body,</hi> and the reaſon is, for that the exulcerated matter doth diffuſe throughout the whole <hi>body</hi> its evill vapours, which corrupteth and very much offendeth the <hi>heart</hi> in ſuch wiſe, whereby to occaſion and haſten the death of the poore beaſt: if in time the malady be not diſcovered, and skilfully and by Art cured. I have intreated ſufficiently upon this ſubject, to wit, of the nature of this infirmity, and the ſignes how to know the ſame. And therefore I thinke it time we doe goe to the Cure.</p>

It is ingendred ſometimes of corrupt <hi>bloud,</hi> which heats and ſurfets have occaſioned in the <hi>Body,</hi> ſometimes by hurts and wounds received, as alſo by ſome Cankerous &amp; poyſnous thing, as ruſty ſpurres, ſnaffles, bits, or the like, it is alſo taken from another <hi>horſe,</hi> which is faln into the ſame diſeaſe, alſo by hewing one <hi>legge</hi> againſt another, and being ſmitten with ſome ſtaffe, whereon are hard knots, and ſundry ſuch like meanes and wayes; it comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to a <hi>Horſe</hi> by ſurfets given him, which finding no other way of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance, lais hold of this diſeaſe, wherby the <hi>bloud,</hi> being over much heat, his greaſe molten, and his taking a ſuddaine cold, which is moſt frequent after great heates, then growing in the <hi>body,</hi> and eſpecially in the <hi>bloud,</hi> ſuch obſtructions, corruption, and putrefaction, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any meanes to vent it ſelfe, or to voyde, or evacuate, but by this way only, by growing into knots, Puſtils, Vlcers, or the like, which be ſo contagious and infectious, ſo as if but any other <hi>horſe,</hi> doe but gnaw or lick with his teeth or tongue, upon the place infected, hee
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7066:107"/> will be aſſuredly within a ſhort time after himſelfe infected alſo, and when once a <hi>horſe</hi> is ſtrucken or infected with this leprous malady, if he be not preſently and skilfully cured, it is as infallible death to him, as if he had eyther his <hi>throate</hi> cut, or his <hi>braines</hi> beaten out, with a <hi>Butchers Axe;</hi>

                        </gap>d unto for his Cure: The ſignes of this diſeaſe are ſo plaine and familiar, as that it needeth no deſcription. I will paſſe to the cure. To the end therfore you may go the more ſecurely to work, wherby you may make it an able and perfect cure, eſpecially if you do finde the Puſtils to be malevolent, and greatly inflamed, then the firſt day let him <hi>bloud</hi> in or neere to that <hi>Maſter veine,</hi> which doth moſt feed and nouriſh the <hi>Farcin,</hi> then ſo ſoone as you have well <hi>bloudied</hi> him, give him this purge, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Aloes, made into fine power one ounce, and a quantity of London Triacle ſo much as will ſuffice, and of life hony ſo much as will ſuffice, mixe theſe well together, and give it him in a morning faſting, and ſix houres after, give him white water, neyther needeth this <hi>bloudying</hi> him, or Purgation, any way hinder him from being dreſſed for his diſeaſe, for that <hi>bloud-letting</hi> doth but only hinder it from running any farther for that time, and the Purge ſendeth the diſeaſe from the <hi>heart,</hi> to the end it may no way annoy that place, wherefore for the perfecting of the cure.</p>
                     <p>Take of oyle de-Bay two ounces of Euforbium made into fine powder one ounce, incorporate both theſe ſo well together, that they may become but one body, then fearch for the firſt origin, or ſpring, where the firſt knots did begin, and ſo continue ſearching till you find out the laſt, clip away the <hi>hayre</hi> from off, and about all theſe knots, and annoynt them very well with this oyntment once every three dayes; and after you have thus dreſſed him three times, if you do not find the Farcins to be killed, and that the knots do not dry up, then bathe the places three dayes together with the ſtale or vrine of a Cowe, or Oxe, and with the hearbe called <hi>Lions foote,</hi> in latine, <hi>Leontipodium,</hi> both boyled together, and this will cure him. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>.

                     <p>Take nine leaves of the pot herbe called Beetes, of the ſmalleſt but ſoundeſt leaves, and nine grains of Bay-ſalt, beat theſe very well together to ſalve, and in a morning before Sun-riſing, put this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine into both his <hi>Eares</hi> by equall portions, and put into them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, a little wooll, to keepe in the medicine, and ſo ſtitch up his

                        <hi>eares,</hi> and let him ſtand ſo with meate and white water 24 houres at the leaſt, then take forth the wooll and ſtuffe, and he is cured. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> With this receit I have cured ſundry <hi>horſes.</hi> Another. If your <hi>Horſe</hi> have a <hi>farcin</hi> in any of the foure quarters of his <hi>body,</hi> let him <hi>bleed</hi> well in the <hi>necke veyne</hi> faſting, then</p>
                     <p>Take of Arſenick two ounces, and put it into a piece of new cloth, and binde it up with a piece of new Pack-threed, and faſten it unto the <hi>mayne</hi> of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> this is to be thus adminiſtred, if the farcin be onely in the foreparts, but if the diſeaſe be as well in the hinder-parts, as in the fore-parts, then hang alſo the like quantity of Arſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, made up in a cloth like as was the former, and hang that alſo upon his <hi>tayle,</hi> and the more you ride, work, or travell, and exerciſe him, the better it will be for his diſeaſe, to qualifie and rid the ſame, and the more ſpare his dyet be, the ſooner is he cured, provided you keep him warm in the ſtable, and for ſome time you muſt give him white water. This cure I did never try, but it was taught me by a great <hi>Mariſhall of Paris,</hi> one who had the repute of a very honeſt man, and a moſt skilfull Ferrier, who proteſted unto me that he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured many <hi>Horſes</hi> with this receit.

And two dayes after his <hi>bleeding,</hi> you ſhall begin to give him again his wheat bran prepared as before, which ſhall continue for ſixe dayes together, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time you ſhall give him every evening with his Oats, this powder and theſe roots following, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Comin, of Linſeed, of Fenugrick, Sileris. Montani, of each two ounces, quick Brimſtone, foure ounces, let all theſe be powdred, and mixe them well, and give it at one time with his Oates, ſo much as you may put into an egge ſhell, the meat being firſt taken out; let him be thus uſed daily, by the ſpace of ſixe dayes. Thoſe dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended,</p>
                     <p>Take the root of Salerick, the root of Taſſus-Barbatus, the root of Valerion, and the root of Lappaizon, of each like much, chop them all very ſmall, as hearbs to the pot, which being thus well mixed, give them to the <hi>Horſe</hi> without Oates if he will eate them, if not, then otherwiſe in Pils; and when you give him the roots, do not give him the aforeſaid powder, and ſo continue him with theſe roots ſixe dayes together, which ſixe dayes ended, cauſe him to be <hi>bloudied</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine on the other ſide of the <hi>necke,</hi> but then let him not <hi>bleed</hi> ſo much as before, and order him as before after the firſt <hi>bleeding:</hi> nor ſhall you give him either powder or roots, but let him be ſtill kept warm,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7066:108"/> and have his ordinary allowance of meate, as well of Hay as of Oats, and then for ſixe dayes after, every evening after he hath drunke white water, give him one evening of this powder with his Oates, and the next evening of theſe rootes, and if you finde not the <hi>Farcin</hi> to dry up to your minde, continue then this powder and theſe roots for ſixe dayes more, and thoſe dayes being paſt, give him good Hay and good Oates, and not any longer the powder, or the rootes: and thus following theſe directions punctually, your <hi>Horſe</hi> ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, and be brought into good ſtate and health again, neither ſhall the relicks of the <hi>farcin</hi> remaine in any part of his body, and if there be any knots remaining, they ſhall breake, purge, cleanſe, heale, and dry up, the maine cauſe being taken and purged away. Of this my ſelfe had never tryall by reaſon that many of the ingredients were not eaſily to be had. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take blacke Elebore, and adde to the hearb ſome of its juyce, put unto it old Boares-greaſe, and boyle it untill the juyce be quite boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into it, whereby to bring it to a perfect unguent, with which you ſhall annoynt and rub the knots, or buttons of the <hi>farcin,</hi> but before you doe apply this unguent, let the <hi>hayre</hi> be ſhaven or clipped away from and about the knots. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> With this receit I have cured onely one <hi>Horſe.</hi> Another:</p>

                     <p>Albeit that all theſe receits be very good for the <hi>farcin,</hi> yet are not all <hi>Horſes</hi> cured with one and the ſame medicine; and moſt certain it is, that the moſt infallible way to cure the <hi>farcin,</hi> is to give him the <hi>fire:</hi> in the practiſe not onely of this cure, but of many others alſo, which are to be adminiſtred inwardly, it is greatly behoofefull that the <hi>Ferrier</hi> be mindfull to obſerve the ſtrength, age, quality, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> to which he is to adminiſter, and accordingly to mixe and apply his ingredients.

                     <p>Take the juyce of Rue, and of Aqua-vitae, of each one ſpoonfull and a halfe, beat them well together, and by equall portions convey it into both his <hi>eares,</hi> then ſtitch them up for 24 houres ſpace, and he is infallibly cured. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is an excellent cure, and by me often uſed.

                     <p>Take Hempeſeed one pound, and bruiſe it well, then take Rue, and ſalt, of each one handfull, of the leaves of Mallowes two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, boyle all theſe in faire water two quarts, unto a moyety, then ſtraine it, and give it your <hi>horſe</hi> bloud warme, give him of this two mornings, but not two mornings together, but let him ſtay one morning betwixt, then take a good quantity of Chamberly and Hem-lock ſo much as will ſuffice, and boyle them well, and waſh the ſores till they be quite whole, and dryed up. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>.

Now Sir, if you be pleaſed to obſerve ſtrictly and carefully, you ſhall alſo finde that <hi>feavers</hi> doe come many times alſo from a quite contrary cauſe; as from cold taken upon hard riding, or great labour, and by having at ſuch times cold water given him to drink, or by waſhing, or walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing having ſweat much, or by being out too late in the gripſe or ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of the evening, or upon day breaking, eſpecially neere or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong fenny, mooriſh, or mariſh grounds, by reaſon that naughty vapours do ariſe from ſuch kinde of places: <hi>Feavers</hi> alſo do accrew to <hi>Horſes</hi> when upon hard riding, and great toyle, you give your <hi>Horſe</hi> cold water drawn out of a Well, which being much colder
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7066:112"/> then either River, or Pond water, doth more chill the <hi>Horſe</hi> inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereby he is much more diſtempered, cauſing him to quake, and to ſhake exceedingly after his drinke, which occaſioneth crudities, and an evill habit in the <hi>ſtomacke,</hi> which doth beget and ingender an <hi>ague</hi> or <hi>feaver,</hi> wherefore after ſweating and great labour, I doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you that whatſoever is given him, be firſt ſet over the fire to take away the chilneſſe, whereby your <hi>Horſe</hi> may take the leſſe damage, for that <hi>feavers</hi> taken of this nature, doe commonly prove <hi>peſtilent feavers,</hi> whoſe nature is to infect all his fellowes which are in the ſame ſtable or roome with him, if he be not either ſpeedily removed from his conſorts, or elſe ſuddenly cured; and the reaſon hereof is moſt evident, for that when as a <hi>Horſe</hi> hath been al the whole day tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled (eſpecially in the winter) and brought into the ſtable all hot and ſweating, when in ſhort time after his <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>pores</hi> begin to be ſetled, and to return to his heart again, and to his intrals, then if you give him cold water, you may inſtantly perceive him to fall into a formall quivering and ſhaking for a time, which being once paſſed over, you ſhall ſee him moſt palpably aſſume a moſt extreame and violent burning, and peradventure after fals into a moſt deſperate ſweating, whereby is moſt eaſie to be found in him a generall diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature throughout his whole <hi>body,</hi> together with a formall and dangerous <hi>feaver,</hi> wherefore if the <hi>Ferrier</hi> be not the more expert, it may ſtick cloſer unto him, and remain longer by him then a buſhell of Oats will do.

                     <p>That was but forgotten Sir, I will now therefore doe it. A <hi>foundring</hi> in the <hi>feet</hi> commeth evermore after great and over-vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent labour, whereby the whole <hi>body</hi> is become diſtempered, the peccant and malignant <hi>humours</hi> ſtirred, the <hi>bloud</hi> inflamed, and the <hi>greaſe</hi> molten, which falling down into his <hi>feet,</hi> there ſetleth, and in ſhort time after, to wit, in 24 houres, the poor creature is hardly able to ſtand, or if he do, it is after a very feeble manner, holding his four <hi>feet</hi> together, ſo as you may eaſily with your hand throw him to the ground, beſides he will ſtand trembling, quaking, and ſhaking, as if he had a <hi>ſhaking ague,</hi> nor would he ſtand at all, unleſſe he be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for the <hi>ſoles</hi> and <hi>coffins</hi> of his <hi>feet</hi> will be ſo ſore, his <hi>joynts</hi> and <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes</hi> ſo ſtiffe and benummed, that he cannot ſtand but with very much anguiſh and paine: wherefore if he may have his minde, he would alwayes be lying, and his whole <hi>body</hi> will be diſtempered, and ſo much abound with heat, as rather to deſire cold water, rather then meat, which if it be given him, then will he quake and quiver anew, and be in ſuch pangs for the time, as that you would thinke he would aſſuredly dye. This diſeaſe commeth alſo to a <hi>Horſe</hi> by being watered when he is very fat, and ridden till he do ſweat, cauſing him
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7066:119"/> to take ſudden cold therewith: alſo after a great heat taken, to be ſet up without exerciſe upon the cold Planks, without litter, or to be waſhed, or walked after great labour, the <hi>Horſe</hi> being very hot and ketty, (for this infirmity falleth moſt commonly upon fat <hi>Horſes,</hi> but very ſeldome upon leane) alſo to water your <hi>Horſe</hi> in ſhallow places, or waters where the water aſcends not higher then his <hi>paſternes,</hi> by which meanes through the ſudden coldneſſe of the water at his <hi>feet,</hi> cauſeth the <hi>molten greaſe</hi> deſcending unto the <hi>feet,</hi> to cake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geale, which is the prime ground of this malady. And this not onely my ſelfe, but all the moſt perite <hi>Ferriers</hi> doe with an unanimous aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent acknowledge. And therefore I doe admoniſh you and every man, who is the <hi>Horſes</hi> friend,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to be very carefull not to exerciſe his <hi>Horſe</hi> too ſoon after his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> taking up from graſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whilſt he is very fat; that he doe not over-travaile, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-labour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or over-toyle him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that having travelled hard, and to prevent his <hi>foundring,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> let him be more gently ridden an houre before he commeth to his lodging, to the end he may be choole, and the more free from danger.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if one houre before you get to your lodging, you ride <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> him into ſome River, or other watring place up to the <hi>belly,</hi> (but not deeper) then water him by degrees, ſtill betwixt every draught, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and removing him a little, it would not be amiſſe; but then ſo ſoon as you be come forth of the water, it were very good you did continue him in the ſame pace, going neither faſter or ſlower, (like as I have before inculcated) it will be the better alſo, and your <hi>Horſe</hi> out of danger of <hi>foundring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, forbeare evermore (eſpecially if your <hi>Horſe</hi> be heated) to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> water him in any ſhallow place.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, beſides his being warme ſet up with litter enough, let him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> have ſtore of rubbing, as well of his <hi>legges</hi> as <hi>body,</hi> for it is a moſt wholeſome thing, it diſſolveth molten greaſe very much, and it doth diſſiipate and ſend away bad <hi>humours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, picking and ſtopping of his <hi>feet</hi> in time of journeying, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> after is very good and profitable. And thus have I ſhewed by what meanes this malady commeth to the <hi>Horſe,</hi> howſoever many other wayes there are, which I have touched, by reaſon they are ſo vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly known to every man, and therefore your ſelfe cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them.</p>

And when you are to waſh any ſores therewith, be very carefull that you lay none of this water upon either ſinewes or veynes, for that it will burn them in ſunder, but where Vlcers and fouler old ſores be in the fleſhy parts, this water will work wonders if wounds be waſhed with it, and you carefull in the application thereof. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Of this I have had great experience.

                     <p>There be many cauſes that may make a Horſe to forſake his meate, and yet not be ſicke at all, and ſo alſo by occaſion of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that either comming upon him, or elſe which hath already ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him. And firſt a Horſe may forſake his meate, and forbeare to eate for ſome time, no whit ſicke, as when he ſhall eyther linger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mares, or after graſſe being weary of dry meate: againe, he may forbeare his meate, and yet not be ſicke by meanes of ſome accident or inconvenience bred in him, or befalne unto him, as by having the Lampes, Barbs, Giggs, Bliſters, bloudy-rifts, tongue hurt, paine in the teeth, or ſome ſuch like infirmity in or about his mouth,, theſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7066:124"/> may be cauſes that may induce him to forbeare to eate, and yet the creature not ſicke, but otherwiſe healthy and hungry, and faine would feed, but eyther cannot or dare not. Alſo a Horſe may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his meate, being through the inconſiderateneſſe of his keeper cloyed, whereby he doth loath his meat, ſometimes through over-ayerings morning and evening, ſometimes againe by ſuffering him to eate being very hot after great ſwearing, upon immoderate riding and toyle, or after water or waſhing being alſo very hot. Theſe and many more may be the cauſes why a Horſe may forſake his meat, and yet not be ſicke. And he may alſo forſake his meat by reaſon of ſickneſſe enſuing, as upon Colds, Rhumes, and Catarres newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and beginning to be felt upon him: ſo alſo he may forſake his meat, by reaſon of ſickneſſe which hath already ſeized him, as in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Glanders, Feavers, Morfounding, Conſumption, Dropſie, and the like, whereby it is made moſt apparant that he feedeth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is already ſicke. As touching the firſt poynt, if you doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to forſake his meate, and that you cannot eaſily finde the reaſon thereof, then the firſt thing you doe, ſearch his mouth, lips, and tongue, and if you finde any thing there amiſſe, let it be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amended, but if you cannot finde any thing there amiſſe, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his keeper, and if you may perceive that it came through his default or negligence, either by the cloying him with Provender, or otherwiſe according as I have heretofore touched, then give him a few branches of Savin, and let him be ayered abroad, keeping him upon the Trench faſting to procure him a ſtomack, and then feed him by degrees, and that by a little at once, ſo he will fall to his meat againe with good appetite, feed heartily, and doe well againe. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> But if you doe finde that his forſaking of meat commeth by meanes of any ſickneſſe which hath already ſeized him, then give him this drink, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Take the leaves of Briony, and give him them to eate, and it will bring him to a good ſtomack ſuddenly. This was taught me by a very good Ferrier, who avowed it to me to be ſpeciall good, but I never made triall thereof.</p>

The ſignes to know a galled back are eaſie, for either the backe will be apparantly ſwelled, or the hayre fretted off, the skinne either broken or raw, or the backe either inflamed or impoſtumated, every of which is eaſily to be determined by the eye, or if his <hi>backe</hi> be wrung with the Saddle, and yet not come to be viſible to the eye, yet may you come to the knowledge therof, if taking off the Saddle, ſtroking your hand all along the back, you ſhall perceive him either to ſhake his head, or to winch with his tayle, to rouze, or ſhake, to ſtamp or ſtrike with his feet, to offer to bite, or the like, whereby you may come to know it, and very eaſily to finde out the place grieved. Now if the back be ſwelled, and before it be impoſtuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo ſoon as you ſhall take off the Saddle, and finde the ſame, clap upon the ſwelling a little of his wet litter, and ſo ſet on the Saddle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and let him remain with his Saddle on all night, and in the morning the ſwelling will be abated, and the place it ſelfe become whole and ſound again. Now if the hayre be but galled off, ſo that it doth not impoſtumate, annoynt the place but with a little Butter and Salt melted together, and in twice dreſſing the place will be whole; but if the <hi>backe</hi> be ſo <hi>galled,</hi> as that it is become raw, then the cure is thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>With all my heart Sir. As touching this diſeaſe which we doe call the <hi>Glanders,</hi> it is of all others the worſt, noyſome, and moſt infectious, inſomuch as that <hi>horſe</hi> that hath it, if he be not removed and ſeparated from his fellowes, will infect ſo many as ſhall be with him in the ſame Stable and roome. To finde out the depth, root, and true nature of this diſeaſe, I have greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, as alſo how to cure the ſame. I have alſo had much confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with many the moſt famous and exquiſite <hi>Mariſhals</hi> and <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> abroad, and I have ſeen very much of their practiſe therein, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have I had very ſerious diſcourſes with a number of our beſt Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers and Smiths at home, but I finde not one in twenty can ſpeake truely to any purpoſe of the nature of this diſeaſe, and therefore I do not wonder that they cannot cure a diſeaſe whereof they are ſo much to ſeek. Nevertheleſſe what I do underſtand of this diſeaſe, I will ingenuouſly deliver unto you. The <hi>Glanders</hi> is an infirmity which proceedeth firſt of cold taken, which being neglected, will in time come to be the <hi>Glanders;</hi> you ſhall firſt perceive it by the inflamed kernels and knots which may be felt under the <hi>chaule</hi> of the <hi>horſe,</hi> and as they doe grow in bigneſſe, ſo do the <hi>Glanders</hi> grow and increaſe within the body of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> which firſt beginning with a thin Rhume, aſcendeth up to the head, and ſettleth neer to the brain, and ſo venteth it ſelfe at the noſe, which yet may be eaſily cured, as I have before inculcated, where I entreated of Colds, afterwards it growes thicker, and then it is worſe to cure, but yet faiſable enough, in longer time it commeth yet to a thicker ſubſtance, and its colour is yellowiſh, much like unto Butter, and then it is more hard to cure, but yet curable, albeit that now it is come to be a perfect <hi>Glanders:</hi> but when it commeth to be of a viſcous, and of a tough and ſlimy ſubſtance, and of a green colour, and to ſtink terribly, and that it hath now runne ſome moneths, or peradventure halfe a yeer or better, as alſo having ſome ſmall ſpecks of a reddiſh colour in it, then is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ferriers work or Art to cure the ſame, for in a caſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ableſt Ferrier may receive the foyle, and the <hi>Horſe</hi> dye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hands and cure, as I have often by experience been an eye witneſſe, albeit there hath been no defect in the Ferrier, either in Art, induſtry, care or diligence. I doe therefore averre that I would not have any man (be he never ſo expert an Artiſt) to promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7066:129"/> the cure of every <hi>Horſe</hi> he ſhall take in hand, by the reaſon that the <hi>Glanders</hi> it ſelfe is the thing he muſt cure, but in taking upon him o cure that malady, he muſt before he can have perfected his cure, cure him alſo of many other diſeaſes, which the <hi>Glanders</hi> will bring along with it, as <hi>(v. g.)</hi> the conſumption of the fleſh and lungs, griefes and aches in the head and braine, inflamations under the <hi>chaule,</hi> diſeaſes in the liver, purſiveneſſe, hide-bound, dropſie, ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led legges, and many other infirmities too prolixe to repeat, all which (I ſay) are inherent to the <hi>Glanders,</hi> and its origine that it is of cold paſt all peradventure, howſoever it ſometimes commeth of Surfets, ſometimes of Morfounding, ſometimes by infection, all which (the laſt only excepted) taketh its firſt ſource from cold, and when it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (as before I ſaid) greeniſh with reddiſh ſpecks, accompanied alſo with an offenſive or ſtinking breath, then are his lungs ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by meanes whereof the cure is the more deſperate and difficile. I do therefore adviſe all Ferriers my brethren, who ſhall at any time take upon them this cure, that they doe firſt prepare the body of the <hi>Horſe</hi> with ſuch preparatives and Phyſicke, as are meet to expell his peccant humours, which muſt be alſo very carefully adminiſtred, yea and that according to the ſtrength and ability of the <hi>Horſe:</hi> for the <hi>Horſe</hi> cannot chooſe but be feeble and weake, having of a long time before viſited with a ſickneſſe of this nature, yea peradventure a whole yeere or two before together, during which time he hath continually waſted and languiſhed, wherefore he cannot be ſtrong, but a very weake <hi>Horſe,</hi> and therefore his phyſicke muſt be very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet ſuch alſo which may have operation whereby to work, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe phyſicke is but caſt away. The ſignes how to know this diſeaſe need no further deſcription, and therefore I will proceed to the cure, for the which I will deliver you many receits, ſome whereof I have well experienced, to which I will give my particular marke, like as I have formerly done. And I do the rather inſert the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, becauſe (as I have before remembred) that receit which will not cure one, will cure another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Glanders.</note>The firſt therefore that is to be done in this caſe, is, to prepare his body by giving him for four or five dayes together, in ſtead of his Oates and Provender, wheat Bran prepared, like as I have before ſhewed you in the caſes of ſick <hi>Horſes,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. § 4. <hi>F.</hi> to qualifie and dry up his moyſt and bad humours abounding in him, then let him bloud in the neck, and the next day rake him, and give him this Cliſter.

If your <hi>Horſe</hi> his cold be come to the worſt <hi>Glanders,</hi> which is a continuall running at the <hi>noſe,</hi> and hath ſo runne by the ſpace of divers moneths, ſo that the <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> can do no good, then ſhall you take better then two handfuls of the white cankerous Moſſe which groweth upon an old Oaken pale, and boyle it in Milke two quarts, till one part bee almoſt conſumed, then ſtraine it and ſqueeze the moſſe well, which done give it your <hi>Horſe</hi> luke-warme to drink. Then take two Geeſe-Feathers, and take ſweet Butter, as a bigge Wall-nut, and with the powder of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, finely beaten and ſearſed, worke them together with your knife or ſplatter, till the Butter be brought to a high gold colour, then take two cleane feathers the longeſt in all the Gooſe-wing, and firſt at the quilles ends with a needle faſten two long threds, then with your ſalve annoynt the feathers all over, which done in the dry pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Brimſtone, rowle them over and over, then putting the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ends formoſt, open the <hi>Horſe</hi> Noſthrils, and thruſt them up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his head, then take the threds which are at the quils ends, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them on the top of the <hi>Horſes</hi> head, which done ride him abroad for an houre or two, ayring him in this manner morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and when you bring him into the Stable, after hee hath ſtood tyed up a pretty ſeaſon, unty the threds and draw out the feathers, and wiping them very dry, lay them up, till you have next occaſion to uſe them, and keep his <hi>body</hi> warme.

                     <p>Now the ſecond and well aſſured, and certaine Medicine is to take Elecampane-roots, and boyle them in milke till they bee ſoft, that you may bring them to pap, then with a home give them to the <hi>horſe,</hi> together with the milke luke-warme, being no more then will make the rootes liquid, then having annointed your Gooſe-feathers put them into his Noſthrils, and ride him forth as before is ſhewed. The other receipt for the mourning of the <hi>Chine,</hi> he intituleth thus.</p>

For whereas the firſt Cure was wrought by medicine, this ſecond is perfected by giving of fire. Take an iron with a Button at one end, and make it red hot, then burn him therwith upon the top of his <hi>forehead,</hi> and a little under his <hi>foretop,</hi> and another in the <hi>fore-top,</hi> and foure other in the <hi>necke,</hi> cleane through upon the <hi>creſt,</hi> whereof two of the holes muſt be upon the one ſide of the <hi>creſt,</hi> and two on the other ſide, and to take away and kill the fire, put into every hole Vnguentum Roſarum, and then let him <hi>bloud</hi> in the <hi>necke veine,</hi> and he is cured. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is alſo an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Cure. The French do call this malady <hi>ver-coquin,</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> doe name <hi>Vermiforme,</hi> but they both have but one manner of Cure for the fame. This <hi>Ver-coquin,</hi> or <hi>Low-worme</hi> is a living <hi>worm</hi> which breedeth upon the <hi>back bone</hi> running along the <hi>necke,</hi> and ſo by degrees commeth to the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>horſe,</hi> where with its hard <hi>beake,</hi> it firſt pierceth the <hi>panicle,</hi> and then worketh it ſelfe to the very <hi>brain</hi> of the <hi>creature,</hi> where it lyeth biting, gnawing, and feeding, cauſeth the <hi>horſe</hi> to become enraged, and to dye mad, if otherwiſe he be not cured in time, and therefore the <hi>French Mariſhals</hi> doe affirme, that the prime remedy wherewith to kill and deſtroy this <hi>Worme,</hi> is, by fire, and they hold that it cannot be deſtroyed any other way.</p>

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:</p>
                     <p>Take blacke ſope, and allay it with Buck-lye, and waſh the place
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7066:148"/> well therewith: this done, apply unto the ſorance a plaiſter of Gooſe-dung, and renew it twice a day till it be whole. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Another:</p>

                     <p>Another moſt excellent receit for the <hi>mainge?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take Lithurgie of gold, two pound, beat it to very fine powder, and ſearce it through a fine ſearcer, and put it into a glaſſe which will hold a potttle; then put thereto of the ſtrongeſt and beſt white Wine Vineger that can be gotten, three pintes or better, and for foure and twenty hours after, ſhake it together ever and anone, but the firſt time it muſt be beaten or ſhaken a good time together, to wit, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre at the leaſt without intermiſſion, and then let it ſettle, and ſo keep it in the ſame glaſſe cloſe ſtopped for your uſe. Now when you would uſe the medicine, you muſt make it into a ſalve af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: Take of the oyle of Roſes two ounces, and of the cleereſt of the ſaid Vineger in the glaſſe (which muſt not have any of the Lithurgie in it) two ounces alſo; beat theſe together with a wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſplatter, untill you have brought it into a thick ſalve: Take then of Quick-ſilver the weight of a ſhilling, and firſt mortifie it very well in a little of the ſirrup of Damaske Roſes, the quantity of ſixe or eight drops, and about three or four drops of the ſpirit or oyle of Turpentine; with the ſirrup and oyle, mingle and work theſe things well untill the Quick-ſilver be very well mortified, then mixe it well with the former ſalve, and then put it up into a cleane gally-pot, and ſo keep it; and firſt making the places raw, annoynt them with theſe Vnguents, and it will kill any <hi>mainge</hi> in the <hi>body, mayne,</hi> or <hi>tayle.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is very good. Another very good.</p>
                     <p>Take of Tarre a gallon, of tryed Hogs greaſe, and Bolearmoniack of each two pound, of Pepper one pound, beat the Pepper and Bole-armoniacke to very fine powder, and then mixe all the ingredients together, making them into one body, then firſt ſcrape the ſorance, ſo as you doe raiſe the ſcurfe and dry cruſty ſtuffe, but not to make it raw, or to bleed much, and then annoint all the places infected, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and chafing it in very well, as if it be in winter, let one hold a barre of hot iron neer to the places as you annoint and chafe it in; but
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7066:151"/> if in Summer, the ſunne will do it much better as he runneth at graſſe; and thus dreſſe him every three dayes ſo long as the unguent laſteth, and he will be cured. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is an approved cure.</p>
                     <p>Another. To perform this cure, the beſt way is, to give the fire to the place after this manner: the iron being hot, firſt draw it along either ſide of the chinke, then draw it upon the top of the chink, then draw three ſtrakes (if need ſo require) overthwart, and in ſhort time the hoofe will grow again, ſo as the chink will be cloſed, and remain ſound and whole. And over and above, you may exerciſe him that very next day after you have thus given him the fire, provided his exerciſe be not upon hard, but upon ſoft or ſandy ground. X This is a very able cure taught me by a ſingular <hi>Mariſhall</hi> of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and I have practiſed the ſame upon ſundry good <hi>horſes</hi> here in <hi>England.</hi>

That which the <hi>Italian</hi> taught me is this; firſt open the <hi>necke veyne,</hi> and draw away the inflamed and corrupt bloud, then take of white Wine one pinte, Sallet oyle halfe a pinte, of Rhubarb and of Aloes, of each two drams, of Senae halfe an ounce, of Agarick three drams, Bay berries halfe an ounce, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faron two drams, Duck or Duke powder, and of cordiall powder, of each two drams, make what is to be powdred into very fine powder, and mixe them well together, adding thereunto of life Honey foure ounces, all which being made warme upon the fire, and well brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, give it your <hi>horſe</hi> bloud warme, but you muſt withall underſtand that the ſame day you ſhall adminiſter this drink unto
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7066:152"/> him, he do ſtand faſting upon the Trench three or foure houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and as many after; neither muſt you the ſame day give him any Oates, and let his drink be either a ſweet Maſh, or white water, and keep him warm, and with white water five or ſixe dayes after, and then give him Oates, but in tthe interim in ſtead of Oates, let him have either bread made for him of purpoſe, or elſe Bran prepared; and when you do give him Oates, put in amongſt them Fenugrick bruiſed. X This is I do aſſure you a moſt excellent receit, with which I ſaved the life, and brought to perfect ſanity a <hi>horſe</hi> of price, which was viſited with this infirmity; the ſecond receit which I had of the <hi>Mariſhall</hi> of <hi>Avinion</hi> is this; <hi>(viz)</hi> ſo ſoon as you doe perceive or ſuſpect him to be <hi>morfounded,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Salt one handfull, and put to it of faire water one pinte, and give it him to drink, and ride him moderately upon it till he <hi>ſweate,</hi> and this will cure him if it be adminiſtred ſo ſoon as you may ſuſpect the malady, but if you ſtay three or foure dayes, or longer, before you doe give him this water and ſalt, then take of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Hellebore one ſpoonfull, and of Saffaron one penny worth, of Aſſafaetida, and of Sope of Venice, of each two drams, of Bacca <hi>alias</hi> the ſeeds of Bayes, a farthing worth made alſo into fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, mixe and pound all theſe together well, putting to them of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger one pinte, and give it him bloud warme, then cover him with a wet cloth, and clothe him warme, and ſet him upon the Trench, that he may neither lye down, nor vomit, but let him ſweat an hour after, and then coole and dry him by degrees, and let him be well rubbed, and he will doe well again. X This is alſo a very good receit.</p>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7066:161"/> before, and ſo being againe ridden from off his wind, he fell like as at firſt, having thus the ſecond time recovered breath, hee gave him water the third time, and then rode him as formerly, but now this third time being fallen, when he began to get <hi>breath</hi> again he cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt vehemently, at what time through the violence of his cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Gelding caſt forth of his <hi>mouth,</hi> and that out of his <hi>wind pipe</hi> a hard lumpe of congealed <hi>Flegmatick ſtuffe</hi> of a good bignes, which by this meanes brought up, the Gelding was ever after freed from the malady, and made ſound, and from that houre, had the uſe of his <hi>winde,</hi> as ably, and as well as ever before, and this was the ſtory which one of the ableſt <hi>Ferriers</hi> I do know in <hi>England</hi> delivered unto me (as he affirmed, and I do beleeve him, for that I do know him to be a right honeſt man) from the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>Groome,</hi> who with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vehement aſſeverations affirmed the thing to be moſt true, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe albeit I do Mathematically beleeve that the <hi>Groome</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this hiſtory to the <hi>Ferrier,</hi> I muſt ſay with the <hi>French man Ie croy en Dieu:</hi> But leaving this famous <hi>Groome</hi> to his rare <hi>cure,</hi> let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to cures that are more probable, and now of ſuch cures as I have met with for this diſeaſe.

                        <hi>guts,</hi> being of nature and condition more gentle then <hi>Cliſters</hi> are, and may be applyed when <hi>Cliſters</hi> cannot. It therefore remaineth that the skill of the <hi>Ferrier</hi> be ſuch, as to be able judiciouſly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſeverall natures of every of theſe things, to know how to make choice of his ingredients and ſimples aptly, to underſtand how to compound them punctually and artificially, to diſcern rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he do adminiſter what be the <hi>humours</hi> and maladies wherewith the <hi>creature</hi> is annoyed and viſited, as whether <hi>(V. G.)</hi> it be <hi>Choler, Melancholy, Flegme,</hi> or <hi>Rhume,</hi> as alſo in what part of the <hi>body</hi> the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> offenſive, is moſt predominant, and what ſimples will purge or remove thoſe evill <hi>humours,</hi> for it is requiſite he be able to know right well, and <hi>ad unguem,</hi> the nature and property of every one of them in particular, by reaſon that ſome are much more aſperous and violent then others be, yea many ſimples are <hi>ſtrong poyſons</hi> if they be not well prepared and corrected, and yet their qualities well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and compounded by true Art, and great good judgement, will work wonderfull effects. Thoſe ſimples which be ſtrong, are <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida,</hi> Scamony, Elebore, &amp;c. the more gentle are Manna, Caſſia, Whey, Prunes, &amp;c. But thoſe that be of the meane, or indifferent working, are Rubarb, Agarick, Aloes, Sene, &amp;c. and this I am bold to intimate unto you, to the end you may the better underſtand their natures, vertues, and qualities, and come to know the more ſecurely how to work when occaſion ſhall be offered. The fift and laſt way of <hi>purging</hi> is by graſſe, eſpecially if the <hi>horſe</hi> be <hi>ſurfetted,</hi> and hath been over-toyled the Winter before, for this muſt be done in the <hi>Summer</hi> time, when graſſe is in its beſt heart; but that graſſe which will ſcoure and purge moſt, is a new mown meadow, for that will rake his <hi>guts</hi> very well, nor will he in ſuch a place gather fleſh; I do therefore counſell you not to ſuffer him to remain in ſuch grounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fourteen or fifteen dayes, and then take him forth, and put him into ſome other paſture, where the graſſe hath not been touched with the <hi>Sithe,</hi> for then he will <hi>belly</hi> well, and in ſhort time recover much <hi>fleſh,</hi> and become fat and luſty. This manner of ſcowring will cauſe him to empty himſelfe well, to purge, and ſend away all his bad <hi>humours</hi> and <hi>ſurfets,</hi> eaſe his <hi>limbs</hi> marvellouſly well, do his <hi>legges</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> very much good, refine his corrupt <hi>bloud,</hi> and make him agill and full of <hi>ſpirit.</hi> To mow green Rye before it be eared, is alſo moſt wholeſome, for it ſcowreth, cleanſeth, and cooleth the <hi>body</hi> very much; ſo doth the leaves of Sallowes, and of the Elme: but as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>This commeth to a <hi>horſe</hi> by ſome hurt he hath taken in the <hi>foot,</hi> either by a pricke with a nayle in ſhooing, or by graveling, or by a ſtub, or the like, when it was not ſo well hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that it impoſtumated, and ſo brake out above the <hi>cronet,</hi> which bred the malady; or elſe being neglected, it brake out above the <hi>hoofe</hi> before it was perceived. It is bred alſo ſometimes by a hurt upon the <hi>hoofe,</hi> by a blow, or by ſtriking one <hi>foot</hi> upon the other; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it commeth by evill <hi>humours</hi> which fall down into that place, and it groweth moſt uſually upon the in-ſide of the <hi>foot,</hi> where when it beginneth, it cauſeth a hard round ſwelling upon the <hi>cronet</hi> of the <hi>hoofe,</hi> betwixt the <hi>heele</hi> and the <hi>quarter</hi> of the <hi>long talent,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth an Vlcer at what time it doth beginne to impoſtumate, and it breaketh out above the <hi>Cronet,</hi> like as I ſaid before. The ſignes I have already given you, for the place will be ſwelled the bigneſſe of a haſle nut, and the <hi>horſe</hi> will hault right down. The cure is, ſo ſoon as it is eſpied, to open it above; if it doe begin to be ſoft, then</p>
                     <p>Take Auripigmentum made into fine powder, and infuſe it in the ſtrongeſt white Wine Vineger can be gotten, forty eight houres, and then apply it to the ſore, and it will ſo eat about the <hi>Quitter-bone,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Quitter-bone.</note> as that you may pluck it away with your <hi>finger</hi> or <hi>pliers,</hi> which ſo ſoon as the <hi>bone</hi> or <hi>griſtle</hi> is taken forth, you may heale up the wound with your Coperas water, and green oyntment preſcribed in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. § 4. <hi>G.</hi> till it be whole, but he muſt not come into any wet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the cure. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is very good.

                     <p>Take a Snake the greateſt you can get, and cut off his <hi>head</hi> and <hi>taile,</hi> and flea it, and ſo boyle it in water till the <hi>fleſh</hi> come from the <hi>bone,</hi> and then you may bring the <hi>fleſh</hi> to be a very oyntment; put of this into the ſorance down to the bottome, and this will kill the <hi>Quitter-bone,</hi> and dry up and heale it; but you muſt not ſuffer him to come into any wet, dirt, or gravell, during the time you have him in cure. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> With this medicine I cured one <hi>horſe</hi> onely, for that I had no cauſe to uſe it to any other ſince.

                     <p>Take of Arſenick the quantity of a ſmall beane, make it into pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and put it into the hole of the Sorance, conveying it downe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottome with your inſtrument, and then ſtop the <hi>mouth</hi> of the wound with Hurds, and binde it on with a cloth, and a rowler, that the <hi>Horſe</hi> may not bit it away; and ſo let it remaine foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty houres: then open it, and if you ſhall perceive the wound to looke blacke within, it is a token that the Arſenick did its office in well working, then to allay the fire, and to reſtore the <hi>fleſh</hi> that is thereby
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7066:167"/> become mortified, <hi>taynt</hi> the hole with Turpentine and Hogs-greaſe molten together. Then take Pitch, Roſin, and Waxe, of each like much, and of Turpentine as much as of all the other three, and melt them and ſo make a Plaiſter of Leather, with which you muſt cover the top of the Sorance, but firſt be ſure to convey the aforeſaid <hi>taint</hi> to the bottome, and then lay on your Plaiſter, and thus dreſſe him dayly till you have gotten forth the Core, or ſharpe <hi>Griſtle,</hi> if the Arſenick have not eaten it out before, for if the <hi>Griſtle</hi> be in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the wound and uncovered, you may raiſe it with your <hi>Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> or Inſtrument, and ſo pluck it quite away, for till that be out, the Sorance will not heale; that done, heale it up with your green oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe with this Vnguent.</p>
                     <p>Take of common-Hony, and of Verdegrece in fine powder, of each ſo much as will ſuffice, boyle this till it bee red, and therewith <hi>Taint</hi> the wound till it be whole, keeping evermore the <hi>mouth</hi> of the wound open, leaſt it heale up above before it be well healed at the bottome, neyther let your <hi>Horſe</hi> come into any wet, or go forth of the Stable untill he be throughly cured. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>.

                     <p>Take of <hi>Mares-milke</hi> two quarts, if the ſame may be had, if not,<note place="margin">Rot.</note> the like quantity of the milke of a <hi>red Cow,</hi> then take a lump of Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then take a young <hi>horſe</hi> of or about the age of foure yeares, and of colour blacke, if it may be, if not, then of ſome other colour, run and chafe him about that he may <hi>ſweate</hi> much, then with a <hi>ſpoone,</hi> or with ſome other ſuch like inſtrument, rake the <hi>ſweate</hi> from his <hi>head, necke, breaſt, backe, ſides, ribbes, buttocks, legges,</hi> and in a word, from each part or <hi>member</hi> of the ſaid <hi>horſe,</hi> and get off the ſweat ſo much as you can poſſibly, and ſo put your Arement and your <hi>ſweat</hi> into the milke, which all being well mixed, give him this by equall portions three mornings together, till he hath taken it all, and let him drinke none other drinke after it in ſixe or ſeven houres, but immediately after his drink, let him be led forth into ſome <hi>paſture</hi> where other <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> be, the better to cauſe him to <hi>neeſe, ſtale, dung,</hi> and <hi>empty himſelfe;</hi> for it is very <hi>wholeſome</hi> for him ſo to doe, before he either eate or drink. Having thus done, ſet him up warm and well littered, and if the ſeaſon do ſerve, give him of the green blades of Rye, if not, give him Barly ſteeped in milk three dayes, but renewed every day once. Then after every of theſe drinks, if you feele him cold in the <hi>paſterne joynts,</hi> or that he <hi>trippeth</hi> or <hi>ſtumbleth</hi> as you leade him in your <hi>hand,</hi> meddle no further with him, for that he is paſt cure, otherwiſe for nine dayes together, after morning and evening give him white wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely, unleſſe now and then a ſweet Maſh, and ſometimes give him milke with his white water, if the <hi>Horſe</hi> be not above nine years old, and ſo you may cure him: but if he be elder, this may prolong his life, whereby he may do the more ſervice. This I never did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, but a <hi>Noble Knight,</hi> and a very friend told me, that he hath thus recovered ſundry <hi>Horſes</hi> which have beene viſited with this diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>Take of Peroſen, and of hard Roſin, of each one pound, of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, Virgin-Wax, or for want thereof new Waxe and Sheeps ſuet, of each halfe a pound, of old tryed Hogs greaſe one pound and a quarter, boyle the Gummes and Waxe in white Wine halfe a pint, and then put unto it your Sheeps tallow and Hogs greaſe, and when all is well molten and incorporated, ſtraine it, and whilſt it is yet hot, put in of <hi>Venice</hi> Turpentine one ounce, and ſo work all well together, and when it is cold, poure in the liquor from the ſalve, which put up into a cleane galley pot, or other cleane veſſell for your uſe. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is a moſt ſoveraign <hi>Treate</hi> or Salve wherewith to heale any wound (that is not come to an <hi>Vlcer</hi>) and ſo dry it up. Another moſt excellent powder.<note place="margin">Powder.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take unſlaked Lime, the dry duſt of Tanners Oken Bark and old ſhooe ſoles burned to a cole, of each like much, make theſe into fine powder, and mixe them well, and keep it in a cleane boxe or glaſſe for your uſe. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This powder healeth the <hi>buds</hi> or <hi>knots</hi> of the <hi>Farcin,</hi> after they be broken, and it skinneth them, and if they be firſt waſhed with the juyce of Vervine and ſtrong Vineger mingled together, and then this powder being caſt upon them, will (I ſay) heale and skin them.

                     <p>Take of common Honey two ounces, Roch-Allum, Verdigrece, and Vineger, of each one ounce, make your Allum and Verdigrece into very fine powder, then take of Sublimate finely powdred, two ounces, boyle all theſe a walme or two on the fire; this laid on a Spatula plaiſter-wiſe once a day, or if the wounds be deep, with a <hi>taint,</hi> cureth both ſpeedily and ſoundly; but before you dreſſe him with this Salve, let the Sore be well waſhed and injected with the water laſt above mentioned, made of faire water, Coperas, and bay Salt. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is a moſt approved cure, and good beyond all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, for it cureth not onely ſores and wounds in any part in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Horſe,</hi> but in the <hi>foot</hi> which way ſoever it may happen, and it cleanſeth any wound from dead or proud <hi>fleſh.</hi> Another:</p>
                     <p>Take the buds or tendreſt tops of the leaves of Elder, one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and firſt ſhred, and after pound them very well, till you bring them to a perfect Salve,<note place="margin">Salve.</note> and apply this to the ſore, binding a cloth upon it to keep it from falling off. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This will cure any old or new ſore whatſoever in any part of the <hi>body,</hi> as <hi>galled backs, Spurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, gravelling, prickt,</hi> or <hi>accloyed,</hi> the wound being dreſſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with every day once, it will cure any <hi>Fiſtula</hi> if the juyce thereof be injected to the bottome. With this one thing alone I have done cures which very good <hi>Ferriers</hi> could not cure. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take common Honey and Verdigrece finely pulverized,<note place="margin">Aegyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> of each as much as will ſuffice, boyle them together till the medicine waxe red, and this will heale up any old or green ſore in ſhort ſpace. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is alſo very good.

                     <p>Take the white of an Egge, and beat it, and lay it upon a few Hurds <hi>plaiſter-wiſe,</hi> but firſt waſh the wound with a little white Wine made bloud warme, and then apply your plaiſter to the ſorance, and then anoynt the <hi>ſhoulder</hi> round about the ſorance with ſweet Butter: do this every day once, and it will be whole. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tryed.

And thus have I diſcovered unto you all the ſeverall ſorts which cauſeth a <hi>Horſe</hi> to hault before, and how to know and diſtinguiſh the places grieved, together with the occaſion of every particular griefe. It followeth that we diſcuſſe yet further the meanes how to diſtinguiſh an old griefe, from a new taken ſtraine or hurt, which without an exact ſcrutiny, cannot eaſily be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, for oft times a <hi>horſe</hi> hath gotten a ſtraine, for which he is preſently turned to graſſe, where peradventure he runs the whole Summer, and ſo by that meanes ſeemeth to goe upright, till he be heated and ſtrained anew, and then will it appeare again, howbeit upon his firſt riding it may not appeare: you have therefore three wayes whereby to finde our his lameneſſe,<note place="margin">Three waies to finde out lameneſſe.</note> in what <hi>joynt, limb,</hi> or <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> ſoever it lyeth. 1 The firſt way is to take him out of the Stable, and to cauſe him to be turned at the halters end on either hand ſuddenly and ſwiftly upon as hard a way as you can pick out, and if he have any ache, wrench, or griefe in his <hi>fore-parts,</hi> it will appeare, for that when he ſhall turne upon that hand in which the griefe is, you ſhall perceive him to favour that <hi>legge,</hi> and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe run both towards you and from you, eſpecially down a little yeelding hill, and if he have any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>herein the griefe reſideth; but if you be not able to finde out his <hi>lameneſſe</hi> this way. 2 Then your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way muſt be for you to take his <hi>backe,</hi> and to ride him out a good round trot or pace a full houre, or ſo long untill ſuch time as you have throughly heat him, then ſet him up, and let him ſtand quiet two or three houres, and then either take his backe againe, or
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7066:174"/> elſe turne him at the halters end as before, and by thus doing, you may diſcover the leaſt griefe that may be in him, eſpecially when you thus ſtir him, if it be done upon ſtony or hard ground, for then he can neither will or chooſe, but either to favour the member grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or elſe to hault right downe. 3 A third way we have, and that is, to know whether the griefe doth proceed from a hot or cold cauſe, for if it proceed from a hot cauſe, then will the <hi>Horſe</hi> hault moſt, when he is hot, and in the middeſt of his travell; but if it be of a cold cauſe, then will he hault leaſt whilſt he is hot and moſt rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and travelled, and moſt at his firſt ſetting forth, whilſt he is cold; and thus much for lameneſſe and halting before.</p>
                     <p>Now you perceiving your <hi>horſe</hi> to hault, and that you be aſſured that his lameneſſe is not before, then may you be confident it muſt be behinde, which being ſo, the griefe muſt of neceſſity be either in the foot, or in the nether joynt, in the paſterne, or in the legge, in the hamme, or in the hough, in the ſtifling place, or joynt, or in the hip. If the griefe be either in the legge, paſterne, or foot, if you doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him well, you ſhall underſtand it by the very ſame ſignes which I have inculcated already in the legges, paſternes, or feet, for that the ſignes be the very ſame; if it be in the bending of the hamme, you may then eaſily know it to be a plaine Selander. If it be in the hough, then is it either a bone or bloud-Spaven, which is eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be diſcerned, or elſe it muſt come of ſome blow, wrench, or ſtraine, neither then will the ſwelling eaſily appeare, but you ſhall perceive it either by the ſtifneſſe of the joynt, or elſe you ſhall finde the place to be hot and burning if the paine ſhall lye in the ſtifling place, it is manifeſtly diſcovered by his gate, for then you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in his going, to caſt the ſtifle ioynt outward, and you may plainely ſee the bone on the inſide to be bigger then the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his toe will hardly touch the ground. If it be in the Hip, which is upon the ſide of the buttock, and if the hurt or wrench be newly taken, you ſhall eaſily know it, in that the <hi>Horſe</hi> will goe ſide-long like a Crab, not being able ſo well to follow with the grieved legge as he can doe with the other. Notwithſtanding if it be a hurt taken, long before, you ſhall perceive the Hip to be falne lower then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the fleſh to ſhrinke, you may alſo perceive it the better, as by going up a hill, or upon yeelding ground, by reaſon he cannot goe with ſo great eaſe, as when he goeth upon even or plaine ground. But the better to diſcover in what part behinde the griefe lyeth, let his Keeper take him out of the Stable in a long raine or coller-haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and let him runne him in his hand the full length of the rayne, for that in which legge ſoever the griefe is, you ſhall perceive him to favour it, but if you finde him to goe upright, without favouring any legge, then let your man take his backe, and ride him out a good trot or hand gallop, till he be warmed, then ſet him up, and let him ſtand an houre or two till he be cold, then take him forth againe, and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7066:174"/> let your man trot him in his hand at the end of the Rayne as he did before, and thus you ſhall perceive him to hault and complaine, and well obſerving him and his gate or going, you may eaſily finde the place grieved. And if any lameneſſe whether before or behinde, doe proceed from any hot cauſe, then you ſhall beſt know it, for that the more you travell or exerciſe him, and the warmer he is, the more he will hault. But if his griefe ſhall proceed from any cold cauſe, then will he halt moſt, being cold after he hath been travelled and ſet up warme.</p>

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7066:180"/> was; it taketh its reſidence for the moſt part upon the inſide of the <hi>ſhanke</hi> about the middle thereof, but ſometimes again higher e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven adjoyning to the <hi>knee,</hi> which if it be there, then it is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile to cure.

                     <p>This is a very troubleſome diſeaſe, and it commeth of groſſe and bad <hi>humours,</hi> gotten principally by violent exerciſe, and intemperate riding, and it commeth from the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Spleen,</hi> which falling down into the kidneyes and bladder, ſettleth there, whereby there groweth in the <hi>mouth</hi> of the <hi>conduct</hi> certaine inflamed hard

                     <p>The cure is, take Saxafrage, Nettle-roots, Parſley-roots,<note place="margin">Stone.</note> Fennell-roots, Sperage-roots, and of Dodder, of each one handfull, bruiſe all theſe things, and boyle them on a gentle fire with white Wine, untill a third part be conſumed, then put unto it of Salt one handfull, of Sallet oyle, and of the Lard of a Goat, of each three ounces, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney halfe a pound; when all this is boyled, ſtraine it, and wring it very hard, and of this give your <hi>Horſe</hi> one pinte every morning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, made bloud warme, and if in the boyling or by ſtanding, it happen to become thicke, diſſolve it again with white Wine, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt boyling it muſt be but onely warmed.

                     <p>Take of ſtrong Ale one quart, and put it into a pottle pot, then take ſo many of the reddeſt Radiſh roots, cleane waſhed and ſliced into ſmall pieces as will fill up the pot, then ſtop up the pot ſo cloſe, as that the <hi>ayre</hi> cannot get in, and let it remaine foure and twenty hours, then ſtraine the roots from the Ale very hard into ſome other clean pot, and ſo give it him in a morning faſting with a <hi>horne,</hi> then ride him a while upon it, and ſo ſet him up warme covered and well lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and in a little while you ſhall ſee him <hi>piſſe,</hi> give him this drink ſundry mornings together; and during this cure, let him have but onely white water to drink. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is ſpeciall good.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in not feeding or ſeeing him fed ſo well as was fitting; Sixtly and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> laſtly, by reaſon the <hi>Horſe</hi> might have ſome ſecret infirmity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his <hi>maſter</hi> might be ignorant. Wherefore if your <hi>Horſe</hi> may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in his travell to <hi>tire</hi> or <hi>faint,</hi> have patience with him, and do not force him beyond what he may be able to performe, either by ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or beating him, like as many <hi>cholericke</hi> and <hi>paſsionate people</hi> doe uſually, but get to ſome houſe or Inne ſo ſoone as conveniently you may, when firſt you ſee him begin to ſinke or to faint under you, ſet him preſently up warme clothed, and well littered, that he take no cold, and let his <hi>Keeper</hi> or the <hi>Oſtler</hi> of the <hi>Inne</hi> rubbe and chafe him all over with freſh dry ſtraw, but eſpecially let him rub him againſt the <hi>hayre,</hi> and let him have no meat till two houres or more after you have given him this drinke.</p>
                     <p>Take of the beſt ſweet Sack one pinte, but if that cannot be had,<note place="margin">Tyring in travell.</note> then take the ſame quantity of White or Claret Wine, and put ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of Cinamon, Ginger, Nutmegs, Graines, Cloves, Anniſeeds, and Fennell-ſeds, of each one ounce, all made into fine powder: then take red Sage, Roſemary-tops, Mints, Camomill, and wilde Thyme, of each like much, ſo that in all they amount to halfe a handfull, chop the hearbs very ſmall, and then put all theſe Hearbs and Spices into the Wine, and then boyle them a pretty while, then take it from the fire, and ſtraine it hard, and unbit your <hi>horſe,</hi> and give him this drink bloud warme; this done, Bit him up againe, and with a ſwitch ſtir him up and down as he ſtandeth in his place tyed to the Rack, then coole him, and two houres after his drink, give him firſt ſome Hay, and halfe an houre after that, give him either a ſweet Maſh, or white water, and after feed him at your pleaſure, but be you conſiderate in giving him his Provender by little at once and often, and howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feed him well, and thus ordering him, by morning he will be well recovered, and able to travell againe. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent drink, and of great vertue for any <hi>Horſe</hi> that <hi>tyreth</hi> or falleth ſick upon the way. It is alſo very requiſite that with a Syringe you do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this drinke into his <hi>noſtrils.</hi> Another. If you doe feare that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7066:190"/> your <hi>horſe</hi> may tire in his journey, for prevention, carry with you a boxe of powder of dryed Elecampane roots, and let the powder be alſo ſearced, and when you do come unto your Inne, let him not be walked, but ſet up warme in the Stable clothed and littered, his <hi>legs, body, head,</hi> and <hi>necke,</hi> be by the <hi>Groome</hi> or <hi>Oſtler</hi> well rubbed, but chiefly his <hi>Poll</hi> betwixt his <hi>eares.</hi> Then take of ſtrong Ale one quart, or of ſweet Sack one pinte, which is much better, and put into it of your Elecampane halfe an ounce, brew them well together, and give it him with a horne, then bridle him, and tie him to the Racke, but not too high, ſo as he may put down his <hi>noſe,</hi> and let him ſtand ſo an houre, then unbridle him, and give him Hay, and an houre or better after that, give him either a ſweet Maſh or white water, and then Provender ſufficient, but with diſcretion and by degrees, and ſo alſo in the morning, give him both Oates and Bread, whether he will eate beſt, feeding him by little and little ſo long as he will eate, and in the morning when you are ready to take his <hi>backe,</hi> give him the ſame drinke againe, and you ſhall finde him to travell with <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>mettle;</hi> and if you tye a branch of Penny-royall upon his Bit, it will greatly comfort him. But yet for all that which hath been ſaid, if he happen to tire, then</p>
                     <p>Take Arſmart, and rub his <hi>bare backe</hi> where the Saddle reſteth, and lay alſo ſome of the leaves upon his backe under the Saddle, and ſo clap on the Saddle, and this will cauſe him the better to hold out. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is good. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take the beſt Spaniſh Tobacco you can get, ſhred it ſmall, and dry it, and make it into fine powder, and mixe therewith the powder of Cockle ſhels of the like quantity, which muſt be ſearced, and put this powder into a glaſſe, keeping it cloſe ſtopped, and ſo keep it to your uſe. And when you are to uſe it, take of this powder, and mixe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with of the oyle of Dill, and of the oyle of Cloves ſuch a quantity as will make this powder into a ſtiffe paſte, and ſo make it into <hi>pils,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pill the bigneſſe of a Walnut, which muſt be dried in the ſhade (theſe Pils muſt be made in the Canicular or Dog dayes onely) then keep them cloſe ſtopped in ſome glaſſe or gally pot, that no ayre can get into it, and when you have cauſe to uſe any of them, give him one of them at what time you ſhall perceive your <hi>horſe</hi> to faint or tire, or that you do perceive him to have taken a cold or ſurfet, which may very well be the cauſe of his debility, give him (I ſay) one of theſe <hi>Pils</hi> when you do come unto your Inne. But if hee hath taken a cold or ſurfet, then give him a <hi>Pill</hi> in the morning faſting, and let him be well rubbed, clothed warme, and well littered, and ſuffer him not to drink any cold water, but either a ſweet Maſh or white water, for there is not any thing more noxious then to give a <hi>horſe</hi> in this caſe cold water, and let his travell be moderate and with great diſcretion, and he will both hold out his journey, and get ſtrength and fleſh alſo in his travell. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> And this I have often tryed both upon my own

                     <p>Take two of the greateſt roots of Polipodium you can get from the Oke, waſh and ſcrape them very cleane, and tye it to his Snaffle,<note place="margin">Vomiting.</note> Trench, or Bit, then let it be ſteeped in the oyle of Spike a whole night, and in the morning faſting put on his bridle with the ſaid roots, and ride him with it in his mouth an houre or better faire and ſoftly, and if he be troubled with any rhumaticke or phlegmaticke humour, or with any cold or other filthy matter which may any way peſter, clogge, or annoy his ſtomacke; this thing will force him to vent them at his mouth and noſe, and it wil cauſe him to cough and neeze, whereby he will ſend forth a great abundance of filth and evill ſlimy ſtuffe from off his ſtomacke and head, as that in ſhort time he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very cleane in his body, for this will both refine his bloud, and exhauſt all his watry humours, in ſuch ſort as by temperate ordering him, and doing as I have here preſcribed you, you may be confident to keep him a long ſound, perfect, and ſerviceable <hi>horſe.</hi> And this is not to be applied onely to a <hi>horſe</hi> newly taken from graſſe, but to any other <hi>horſe</hi> that hath taken a cold, or to any ketty, foule, foggy, or purſive <hi>horſe</hi> whatſoever. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This may ſeeme ſtrange here

                     <p>Sir, for this infirmity I make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme which is this.</p>
                     <p>Take Wheate flowre foure pound, Elecam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane and Gentian, of each one ounce, Anniſeeds, Fenugrick, Comyn, Brimſtone, and Licoris, of each halfe a pound, let all theſe be made into very fine powder and ſearced, then put unto it of common Engliſh Honey halfe a pound, and ſo much white Wine as will make all theſe things into a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme, boyle all theſe ſufficiently, till it be ſo thicke that you may make it into Pils, and give your <hi>horſe</hi> of them three or foure at a time for ſixe or eight mornings together.

But if you doe perceive a taint in his winde, then</p>
                     <p>Take a cloſe earthen Pot or Pipkin, and put thereinto of the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt white Wine Vineger three pints, and foure new laid Egges un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7066:192" rendition="simple:additions"/> and foure heads of Garlicke cleane pilled and bruiſed, then cover the pot very cloſe, and bury it in a Mixen or Dung-hill twelve houres, then take it up, and take forth the Egges, but breake them not, then ſtraine the Vineger and Garlick through a fine linnen cloth, putting unto the liquor of life-honey foure ounces, and of browne Sugar-Candy, Anniſeedes and Licoris, all made into very fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of each two ounces, and your <hi>horſe</hi> having faſted all night till morning, give him one of the ſteeped Egges, and then one hornefull of this liquor or drinke, and then another Egge, and after that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hornefull, and ſo a third Egge, and then an hornefull, and laſtly a fourth Egge, and ſo the reſidue of the liquor, remembring to give him into eyther noſethrill halfe a hornefull of his drinke, and it muſt be adminiſtred bloud-warme, then ſet him upon the Trench, cloth, ſtop, and litter him warme, and let him ſtand ſo foure houres, then unbit him, and if it be in Winter time give him ſweet Wheate-ſtraw, but no Hay, and if it be in Summer, give him graſſe, greene-corne, or the leaves of Sallowes, and for nine dayes give him eyther ſweete Maſhes, or white water, putting therein ſome Salet-oyle, and be you aſſured hee will doe well againe. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>.

                     <p>Yea Sir, there is, and it is a diſeaſe moſt dangerous and very difficult to cure, but by a Receipt of a powder which once I obtained of a skilfull Chirurgion, which ſaid powder is not fit to bee applyed to any living creature, but to a <hi>horſe</hi> only it is ſo terrible. And thus it is to be made, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of living Toades foure, the greateſt and blackeſt can bee found, living Moles or Ants three, and of old Shoo-ſoles ſixe, and heads of Garlick unpilled, and with their beards or roots remaining upon them forty, then take of the leaneſt and ſalteſt Martlemas-beefe three pounds, cut it into thin and ſwall peeces and ſlices, ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemas-beefe I meane which hath longeſt hanged in the ſmoake: take alſo of Oates eight pints, and of old woollen-ragges the couſer the better two pounds; take alſo of Swallowes-dung a good quantity, and foure or five living Swallowes, put all theſe things into an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-pot new, and well nayled, and let it bee big enough to be able
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7066:192"/> to hold all the Ingredients, and put alſo all thoſe living-creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them alive, and then make a Cake of Clay, and therewith lute up the Pot ſo cloſe, as that neyther ſmoake nor ayre can eyther get in or out; having ſo done carry your Pot into ſome Orchard or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cloſe, or Back-ſide, from Houſing or Straw, and there place it, and ſo make a great fire both round about it, and upon it, and ſo keep the fire unto the Pot, till it bee as red-hot as the very fiery-coles themſelves, and let the fire continue ſo great after the pot is red-hot by the ſpace of halfe an hour at the leaſt: then let the fire remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched untill it be all conſumed to aſhes, and ſo go forth of it ſelfe, without eyther quenching the ſame, or taking away any of the fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and ſo let it ſtand till it be through cold, which will hardly be done the ſame day, ſo when the Pot is through cold, take it from the place, and opening it, take forth the ſtuffe, and put it into ſome Trough or great Morter made for the purpoſe, which muſt ſtand in ſome out or open place where no winde can come, the Trough or Morter being covered with a cloth, that the powder may not fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there pound and ſtamp theſe things together into fine powder, and in the ſtamping, adde thereunto of unſlacked-Lime one pound. Let him that ſtampeth it be cloſe muffled, and his eyes covered with a glaſſe-caſe made for the purpoſe for feare of hurting them; and when it is throughly powdred, ſearſe the powder through a courſe Haire-cloth, and ſo keepe the very fineſt of the powder for your uſe, in ſome cleane glaſſe or gally-pot. This powder killeth all <hi>Wilde-fires</hi> whatſoever, and all running Sorances and Vlcers, provided it be applyed to fleſhy-places, and not to places where <hi>veines</hi> or <hi>ſinewes</hi> be, for that it will burne them in ſunder. X. This I have made ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, and often uſed it, and to cure and dry up old ſores and Vlcers (this powder being diſcreetly uſed and rightly applyed) a better thing then this truly I know not, eſpecially if the cure be ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſperate or dangerous.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Wind gaules</hi> are terrible Sorances, which do breed in the <hi>legges</hi> of a <hi>Horſe,</hi> as well on the outſide as on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, a little above the <hi>Fet-locke ioynt,</hi> and by their ſwelling are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered, and made viſible to the <hi>Eye,</hi> for they bee bladders, wherein lyeth a Ielly, which being let forth is thicke, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the yolke of an Egge, whereof ſome will be bigger, and ſome leſſer. It commeth moſt commoly to <hi>Horſes</hi> in the Summer-time, by reaſon they are ridden upon hard ground, and the <hi>Horſe</hi> being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-heat by too hard riding, his greaſe falleth downe into his <hi>legges,</hi> and ſetleth there, and by that meanes breedeth this Malady, wee call <hi>Wind-gaules,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wind-galles</note> and they will be ſo painefull unto him, as to cauſe him many times to halt. The ſignes to know them are by the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in that place before named, which be moſt eaſie to be ſeen and felt. The cure is eyther to ſtricke with your Fleame or to open them with your Inciſion-knife, and to let and cruſh out all the congealed ſtuffe which is therein, opening the place no further then through the <hi>skin,</hi> and you muſt be carefull of the <hi>ſinew,</hi> which lyeth cloſe to that place: then.</p>
                     <p>Take the white of an Egge, and Oyle-de Bay ſo much as will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, incorporate them together, and apply it with Hurds Plaiſter-wiſe, and in three or foure dayes thus dreſſing it, he will be cured. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>. Thus have I cured many <hi>Horſes.</hi> Another. After you have let forth the Ielly.</p>
                     <p>Take Pitch, Roſin, and Maſticke, of each like much, boyl or but
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7066:193"/> melt them together, and as it cooleth, make it up into rowles bigger or leſſer at your pleaſure, and being thorough cold, apply it with a hot iron to the orifice, and ſo round about the place of the ſorance on either ſide of the legge, and ſo ſoon as you have layed on this charge, and before it can be cold, clap on Flocks, and this will dry up the Wind-gaules, and heale them. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is ſpeciall good. But during not onely theſe two cures, but all other for this malady, you muſt not ſuffer your <hi>horſe</hi> to come into any Well by any means. Another. Firſt ſhave away the hayre as you muſt doe in all theſe kinde of cures, then open the ſorance as before is taught you, and cruſh forth the jelly and filth, then</p>
                     <p>Take Tacha-Mahacha, Maſticke, Parroſin, of each to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a haſle nut, and of Stone-Pitch to the quantity of a Wall-nut, with a little Brimſtone powdred, melt all theſe together, and when it is molten, put in ſo much Turpentine as a Wall-nut, and ſo ſtirre them together, and when it is cold, make a plaiſter thereof upon lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and apply it warme to the place upon the out-ſide onely upon the orifice, which ought evermore to be made on the out-ſide, then put on the plaiſter it ſelfe, and round about it with the ſame Salve, and clap Flocks upon it, and ſo let him reſt in the Stable, and by kee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping him from wet till he be whole, and let the plaiſter remaine on untill it ſhall fall away of it ſelfe <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is a moſt excellent cure, and I have often made good uſe thereof. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take the oyle of Vineger, and dip your thumb therein, and rub the ſorance therewith every day till the haire do fall off, which will cauſe the Wind-gaules to breake, run, and bleed, then heale and cure the Wind-gaules well and ſoundly. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is as good as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Another. Waſh and ſhave as formerly is ſhewed you, then give fire to the place, that done, open the Wind-gaules juſt in the middle line or ſtroke, halfe an inch at leaſt, and ſo cruſh forth the jelly with your thumb, then</p>
                     <p>Take Pitch, Roſin, and Maſtick, of each like much, and therewith charge the place as before is taught you. This is very good. Another. Firſt waſh and ſhave, and open the place with your fleame, &amp;c. then take of oyle de Bay, and of Turpentine, of each one ſpoonfull, Verdigrece in fine powder, one penny worth, the white of an Egge, and of red Leade two ounces in powder, boyle all theſe to a Salve, and adminiſter it to the place plaiſter-wiſe. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is one of the beſt cures for Wind-gaules that I doe know.</p>

                     <p>Take ſweet Butter, Bay-ſalt, and powder of Frankincenſe, of each as much as will ſuffice, boile all theſe upon the fire, and with a clowt faſtened to the end of a ſticke, even as it commeth boyling from the fire, ſcald it two or three times, but if it be full of corruption, then make inciſion on both ſides from beneath, that the matterative ſtuffe may the more eaſily void away downewards, and after uſe none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing wherewith to heale it up, but onely your uſuall powder of Lime and Honey, which will heale that, or dry other ſuch like hurts. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is moſt excellent, I have often experimented the ſame.

                     <p>Take of white Wine one pinte, halfe a porringer full of Wheate flower, of common Honey one pinte, of Syzes three ounces, boyle all theſe together to an Vnguent, and anoint the places grieved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.

                        <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This I often uſing have found it to be very good. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take three great Onyons, picke forth the cores, making a conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or hollowneſſe in them, then fill them up with the powder of Frankincenſe, then wrap them up in three or four handfuls of Hurds or Tow, then wet the Hurds, and ſo cover and heale them up in the hot embers, and lay upon the top of the embers a good Shovell-full of hot burning coles, and ſo let it remaine untill the Onions be throughly roſted, then take them forth, and ſeparate the Hurds and

                     <p>Take then of the oyle of Worms, of Turpentine, and common Honey, of each two ounces, incorporate all theſe together very well till you have brought them to be one body, and either by Taint or Plaiſter dreſſe the ſorance therewith, and it will heale it up ſound. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> And this alſo is very good.

                     <p>Of this malady I have entreated ſufficiently before in the § of Bots, where I have given you many good receits. Nevertheleſſe I will give you one or two more for wormes onely, and ſo leave you to practiſe.</p>
                     <p>Take the entrails of a great Chick, and with the powder of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Bay-Salt rowled in the ſaid entrails, give it him down his throat, and cauſe him to ſwallow them ſo warm as they come out of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7066:195"/> the belly of the Chicken, but caſt away the Gizard, give him this three mornings together, and every time ride or walk him till he dungeth, and keep him warm, and give him white water, and at three dayes end, give him Rice boyled in water, and after dryed in the Sun, and give him alſo to eate the leaves of Sallowes, and it will cauſe him to voyd the Worms with his ordure, but if you ſhall rake him firſt, it will be the better. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is very good. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take the tender tops of Broom and Saven, of each halfe a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, chop them very ſmall, and work them into Pils with ſweet But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and having kept your Horſe faſting over night, give him them in the morning, to wit, three of thoſe Pils at a time, and then ſet him upon the Trench for two or three hours after, and then give him meat, but no drink at all till night by any meanes, and then let him have warm, but no white water. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This I have often experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and do know it to be a moſt excellent receit.</p>

                     <p>This diſeaſe of the <hi>Yellowes</hi> in a Horſe is the very ſame that Phyſitians do call the Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe in a man; and as there be two ſorts of Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe in a man, ſo alſo are there the like in a Horſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Yellow and the Black, the yellow being moyſt, the black dry; the yellow proceeding from the over-flowing of the gall, occaſioned of choller, and the black comming from the over-working of the Spleen, by means of over-much malancholy, both bad infirmities, but the black worſt, more dangerous and moſt mortall, the yellow is more eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by reaſon of its colour, for it coloureth the whites of the eyes, the tongue, the lips, and the inward parts of the noſtrils, which the black Iaundiſe doth not apparantly, albeit by due and ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you may come to know when your Horſe hath a black Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, for then you ſhall perceive the whites of his eyes, lips, tongue, and mouth to be of a thick and duskiſh colour, and not ſo cleere and ſanguine as before when he was not viſited with any ſuch infirmity, both which are ſo mortall (eſpecially the latter) as that if very great care be not taken whereby to pry into its ſymptomes, the Horſe may
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7066:195"/> fall downe upon a ſudden (as I have often ſeen and known) even as he travelleth, and dye, or elſe he appearing to be ſound and healthy, and to eate his meat like as he was accuſtomed over night when you left him, comming again unto him in the morning, you may finde him dead, ſtiffe, and cold. And the origen of this malady commeth principally of unkindely and unnaturall heats given him by moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and intemperate riding, whereby the Liver becommeth infla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med; the Liver, the Bloud, Gall, and the Spleen, which cauſeth choller to have ſoveraignty and dominion over the other humours, and ſo engendreth this perilous diſeaſe, which ſeldome bringeth a lingring or languiſhing death, but that which endeth him ſuddenly, and therefore it is moſt requiſite that the greater eye and care be had unto it. The beſt ſymptomes how to know it is thus. Your Horſe will be dry in his body, mouth, and noſtrils, being marvellous hot through the abundance of choller that reigneth in him, and he will be very gaunt in his belly towards the flanks, he will be alſo very faint, and not onely ſweat upon every the leaſt motion, but alſo as he ſtandeth in the Stable: his eyes, the inſides of his lips, mouth, and tongue, will be yellow as Saffron, and he will ſeldome lye down, and being layd, he will ſometimes grone. The cure. Firſt let him bloud in the neck and mouth, and let him bleed well, then give him this drink.</p>
                     <p>Take of Turmerick and long Pepper, of each one penniworth,<note place="margin">Yellowes.</note> Anniſeeds and Licoris in fine powder and ſearced, of each halfe a ſpoonfull, Selendine, the leaves and roots one handfull chop, ſtamp, and ſtraine the Selendine, and ſo put all theſe together into ſtrong Ale one quart, warm this upon the fire, and in the warming adde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it of London Treacle one ounce, and of ſweet Butter the quantity of an Egge, and give it him bloud warm, and after keep him warme, and give him white water, and he will do well. <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> This is very good.

                     <p>Take Turmerick, Myrrah, Ivory or Harts-horn, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron one penny worth, make all theſe into fine powder, and ſearce them, and put unto it of the juyce of Selendine a good quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, put all theſe into Muskadine one pinte, Sack or Ale, and let it boile upon the fire a walm or two, then put unto it of ſweet Butter as much as will ſuffice, and of <hi>London</hi> Treacle one ounce, and ſo give it him bloud warm, but let him firſt be raked.
