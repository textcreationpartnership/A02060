            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are juÅ¿tly placed in a glorious Å¿phere, elevated in a moÅ¿t conÅ¿picuous altitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other inferiour and Å¿ubordinate Orbes, from whence (as a Å¿overaign Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter) you behold and judge of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they either reliÅ¿h of worth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit, and (like the Sunne) impartially diÅ¿penÅ¿e the propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beames of your favour, as well to the humbleÅ¿t plant, as the talleÅ¿t Cedar. As I am a recent and freÅ¿h exiÅ¿tent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of your life-tendring influence, for when depreÅ¿Å¿ed and trampled upon by the inÅ¿olency of an unkinde-adverÅ¿ary
<pb facs="tcp:7066:3"/> that raiÅ¿ed me up to tread upon an equall BaÅ¿is with him, who lately had deÅ¿igned me for his foot-Å¿toole. An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of Clemency and IuÅ¿tice, eminent vertues, and truely inherent in your moÅ¿t Royall boÅ¿ome: for which with all humility I bow, and thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e acknowledge, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely honouring them Å¿o conÅ¿picuous in your MajeÅ¿ty, and by you Å¿o frequently exerciÅ¿ed. Thus reÅ¿tor'd, I come charg'd with a Booke, which I moÅ¿t humbly proÅ¿trate at your feete, becauÅ¿e I feare it is not conÅ¿cious of Å¿o much worth, as to merit a kiÅ¿Å¿e from your Å¿acred hand. It is the Embrion of my Å¿tudy, travels, experience, and practiÅ¿e, and cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to forme and perfection without the reflection of your MajeÅ¿ties favour. It brings with it a front not altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, of <hi>HorÅ¿manÅ¿hip</hi> and <hi>Ferriery;</hi> the firÅ¿t not incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the moÅ¿t illuÅ¿trious title and Heroick Spirit; the Å¿econd not unworthy the knowledge, yea the practiÅ¿e of the moÅ¿t accompliÅ¿h'd Gentleman. I know this TreatiÅ¿e cannot hold proportion with Å¿o elated a patronage, as that of your MajeÅ¿ty, although it were inform'd with a farre nobler Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; yet for all this infinite diÅ¿proportion, the Dedication of it unto your Å¿acred MajeÅ¿ty will not appeare much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; for firÅ¿t I received the ability to proÅ¿ecute it from your Grace and favour: Å¿o that deriving its being from you, it belongs of right unto you, and muÅ¿t have recourÅ¿e unto your MajeÅ¿tie for its Å¿afety and protection. Secondly, it is the off-Å¿pring of my age, and cannot but leave a fatall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation in its Parents infirmity, and therefore (eÅ¿pecially in theÅ¿e cenÅ¿orious times) cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t without your Royall protection. LaÅ¿tly, as you have taken the rationall creatures of this your tripartite Kingdome into your titular care, Å¿o have you not excluded the irrationall, albeit in a different condition, much leÅ¿Å¿e the <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> whoÅ¿e GeneroÅ¿ity, and uÅ¿e have given him the precedency in your MajeÅ¿ties eÅ¿teeme, before all other bruit Å¿pecies; Å¿o that this Booke (which beautifies his Å¿hape, encreaÅ¿es his courage, delivers rudiments for his menage, preÅ¿cribes cures for his diÅ¿eaÅ¿es,
<pb facs="tcp:7066:3"/> and in all, enables and advances his race and bravery) hopes to finde your MajeÅ¿ties hand extended and open to receive it. The worke concernes the Common-wealth in generall, and if accepted and peruÅ¿ed with as much zeale and care as I have us'd in the publiÅ¿hing of it; I preÅ¿ume it will not be found empty of profit. My many yeares have given me the priviledge to have Å¿eene and knowne this kingdome rich both in the number and quality of her HorÅ¿es, and it would infinitely grieve me that I now live to Å¿ee her reduc'd to Å¿o deplorable an indignity, but that I am confident I Å¿hall Å¿ee her reÅ¿tor'd to her precedent glory and opulency by your MajeÅ¿ty: and now that I have aÅ¿Å¿um'd the boldneÅ¿Å¿e to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate her poverty, my zeale and reÅ¿pect to my Country, tranÅ¿ports me yet a little further to diÅ¿cover the cauÅ¿es of it, together with the redreÅ¿Å¿es and remedies. FirÅ¿t, thoÅ¿e For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ts, Parks, Commons, Fennes, Moores, and other marriÅ¿h and waÅ¿te grounds, which paid yearely Å¿o rich a tribute of young, able, and Å¿erviceable HorÅ¿es to the univerÅ¿all uÅ¿e of this Kingdome, are at this time diÅ¿afforreÅ¿ted, diÅ¿park't, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, drain'd, laid dry, and converted to other (but much different) uÅ¿es, Å¿o that thoÅ¿e brave breeds and races of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es are much extenuated, or altogether intermitted. Then the Gelders, who in every Å¿hire Å¿o confidently and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciÅ¿e their faculty in a moÅ¿t unlawfull manner, and Å¿pay yong Fillies, by which meanes they become barren, the breeds of HorÅ¿es diÅ¿continued, and the Common-wealth highly prejudic'd and unfurniÅ¿h'd; for inÅ¿tance I can and will (upon occaÅ¿ion) produce a Gelder who Å¿payes more then a hundred Fillies. For redreÅ¿Å¿e of the firÅ¿t, your MajeÅ¿ty may be pleaÅ¿ed to command that thoÅ¿e Statutes which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted for the breeding of HorÅ¿es, may be Å¿peedily and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly put in execution. For the Å¿econd, that you will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e pleaÅ¿e by your Proclamation to inhibit all Gelders that unlawfull and prejudiciall exerciÅ¿e of their profeÅ¿Å¿ion, then Å¿hall your MajeÅ¿ty Å¿ee the noxious and exorbitant diÅ¿eaÅ¿e meet with a Å¿udden and eaÅ¿ie cure, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:7066:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> derive a Å¿enÅ¿ible and ineÅ¿timable benefit from it. Now it reÅ¿ts that I make an humble Apologie for my boldneÅ¿Å¿e, which indeed would be a matter of trouble and difficulty for me to accompliÅ¿h; did I not know your MajeÅ¿tie to be a Prince infinitely tendring the good and welfare of your Kingdome; Å¿o that this treating of a buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e not inconÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, I deÅ¿paire not of obtaining your Royall pardon, but promiÅ¿e my Å¿elfe from your benignity and clemency, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious acceptance of that I have moÅ¿t zealouÅ¿ly delivered.</p>

            <p>But Å¿ince the laying aÅ¿ide of the great Saddle and Cannon, and neglect of the HorÅ¿e of Menage, Å¿ince the applying our Breed only to Racing, or, (as I may better Å¿ay) in furniÅ¿hing our Å¿elves with HorÅ¿es of Å¿peed to runne away from our Enemy, the moÅ¿t ancient honour of HorÅ¿eman-Å¿hip peculiar to this our Kingdome, and for which all other Nations highly eÅ¿teemed us, is now almoÅ¿t va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hed and loÅ¿t; inÅ¿omuch as were we preÅ¿Å¿ed with thoughts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (from which the moÅ¿t prudent and watchfull Eye of our moÅ¿t gracious Soveraigne, Guards us, through his moÅ¿t happie Government) we Å¿hould bee forced (I write this in bluÅ¿hes) to to pull HorÅ¿es from the Coach, and Cart, to fill up our Troopes.</p>
            <p>Let it therefore bee recorded, (my Noble Lord) that whileÅ¿t you were MaÅ¿ter of the HorÅ¿e to his MaieÅ¿tie, an exact obÅ¿ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed throughout this whole Kingdome, for the due breeding of Å¿erviceable HorÅ¿es; to the furtherance of which moÅ¿t Noble deÅ¿igne, if theÅ¿e my ObÅ¿ervations Å¿hall, any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, I Å¿hall bleÅ¿Å¿e my Pen that it ever waded in Å¿uch a Å¿ubiect: profeÅ¿sing my Å¿elfe to owe unto my Soveraigne and Countrey all I
<pb facs="tcp:7066:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> have, and unto them my Labours as a moÅ¿t loyall Subiect and true Patriot, I moÅ¿t humbly offer.</p>
            <p>And my good Lord, theÅ¿e ObÅ¿ervations gathered in my Youth, I was adviÅ¿ed and preÅ¿Å¿ed by Å¿ome Noble Friends (though now old) to publiÅ¿h for the generall good of this our Kingdome: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e for my owne part I Å¿hould have rather Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿ed them, as not being now Å¿o fit a Å¿ubiect for me to treate off, but the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good hath over Å¿wayd me. Wherefore with theÅ¿e Oblations I Conclude, KiÅ¿sing your LordÅ¿hips Hands, and Å¿hall ever profeÅ¿Å¿e my Å¿elfe</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I doe conÅ¿ider <hi>(benevolent Reader)</hi> the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience whereinto that Man is plunged, who brings himÅ¿elfe upon the publique Stage of promulgating his Bookes in print, be the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject never Å¿o laudable, and the Author no leÅ¿Å¿e cautelous and Å¿ufficient, endeavouring with all diligence to prevent the brand of a black cole: nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e all induÅ¿try applyed, he Å¿hall not paÅ¿Å¿e without oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy and aÅ¿perÅ¿ion.</p>
            <p>This very conÅ¿ideration hath Å¿o afrighted and deterred me, that albeit I have had many great motives exciting me to make a tender of the Love, Duty, and Service I beare to my Country; yet when I doe contemplate the many cenÅ¿ures I muÅ¿t undergoe, I have beene evermore diÅ¿heartened as well from beginning, as going forwards in this my deÅ¿ired purpoÅ¿e. NotwithÅ¿tanding partly through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect I beare to my Countries profit and honour, and partly by meanes of the importunity of many my right Noble and generous friends, who have been eye-witneÅ¿Å¿es to Å¿undry of my Cures, and thoÅ¿e not a few uncouth and rare: I have adventured even now in my declining dayes, to leave this Work as a Monument to enÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, no whit doubting, but that the judicious will friendly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof; but as for the malevolent and ignorant, I am moÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the quils they Å¿hall dart at me, cannot goe as from a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine, and therefore will do me the leÅ¿Å¿e hurt or domage.</p>
            <p>I therefore am bold to put into thy hand, this poore work of mine, which I have digeÅ¿ted into tw Bookes: In the firÅ¿t, I lay thee down rudiments how thou mayeÅ¿t breed HorÅ¿es to thy beÅ¿t advantage and liking; which albeit they may appeare unto thee to be recent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, yet if thou wilt be pleaÅ¿ed to put them in ure, and make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (not digreÅ¿Å¿ing from my principles) thou wilt (I doe aÅ¿Å¿ure me) be Å¿o farre from diÅ¿liking them, as never hereafter to Å¿warve or diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent from them. For if we Å¿hall Å¿eriouÅ¿ly ruminate in how high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿teeme that man is who is owner and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿or of good HorÅ¿es, how much commended, how much reÅ¿pected, how much talked of, and how well proffered for them: but when he Å¿hall be knowne to be a
<pb facs="tcp:7066:7"/> breeder of Å¿uch good HorÅ¿es, will not his <hi>encomiums</hi> be the greater? but when together with theÅ¿e himÅ¿elfe Å¿hall be known to be exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ite in HorÅ¿emanÅ¿hip, whereby to cauÅ¿e his HorÅ¿e to Å¿hew himÅ¿elfe in his Pace, Menage, and all other his poÅ¿tures like as well becomes a right good HorÅ¿e, perfectly mouthed, delicately borne, obedient to the hand, and to anÅ¿wer the Switch and Spur, will not (I Å¿ay) that Gentleman be highly commended, and have more eyes upon him as he paÅ¿Å¿eth a long, than are commonly caÅ¿t upon a Comet or the Sun eclipÅ¿ed? yes undoubtedly. For if we doe but note when a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome HorÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿eth along, we may obÅ¿erve the people not onely gaze upon him as he commeth towards and againÅ¿t them, but to turn themÅ¿elves and looke after him Å¿o long time as he continueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their view and Å¿ight: Mans love to the HorÅ¿e is generally Å¿o great.</p>
            <p>Sithence then the HorÅ¿e is a creature Å¿o generous, and therefore Å¿o much liked and beloved of all, in my poore judgement, it Å¿hould Å¿uit very well with every Gentleman of worth, ranke, and quality, to endeavour (if not to breed, yet at leaÅ¿t) to be maÅ¿ters of Å¿uch Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es (which he muÅ¿t keep) that Å¿hall be truely handÅ¿ome and comely, rightly bred, of good colour, cleane Å¿hape, well marked, and Å¿ingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well ridden and made, and Å¿o he Å¿hall the better advance his honour and reputation.</p>
            <p>Having now bred, or otherwiÅ¿e by thy diligent endeavours attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto Å¿uch HorÅ¿es as be truely good, and for thy turne; the Å¿econd thing to be thought of, is, if they be not already made unto thy hand as thou deÅ¿ireÅ¿t to have them, that thou then doe procure Å¿uch a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who is known to be a maÅ¿ter of his Art, or otherwiÅ¿e thou wilt be much deceived, and farre to Å¿eeke of enjoying thy wiÅ¿hed deÅ¿ires, and therefore I have given thee inÅ¿tructions how to make thy choice of Å¿uch a man, whereby thou Å¿halt not be wronged in thy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor thy HorÅ¿e marred in his firÅ¿t making and handling. Neither have I taken upon me to teach him his Art, (for that were a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impertinent) but thoÅ¿e documents which I have Å¿et thee downe muÅ¿t Å¿erve onely to Å¿hew thee how thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t Å¿oone finde whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Rider may be for thy turne or not.</p>
            <p>The third thing which thou art to take to thy conÅ¿ideration, is, the good or harme that may come unto thee by the choice thou makeÅ¿t of thy Groome or Keeper, who may either through his ignorance, or inconÅ¿ideration, Å¿oone make him unfit both for thy owne uÅ¿e, or any mans elÅ¿e: out of which reaÅ¿on I have depainted thee a Groom in his lively colours, and if his conditions and qualities Å¿hall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e than what I have delineated, aÅ¿Å¿ure thy Å¿elfe thou doÅ¿t runne a manifeÅ¿t hazard of marring that HorÅ¿e thou didÅ¿t hope Å¿hould have been to thy hearts deÅ¿ire. And foraÅ¿much as it is a matter very much praiÅ¿e-worthy to be a MaÅ¿ter of good HorÅ¿es, to have them made perfect and ready, to have Å¿uch Riders, Keepers, and Groomes, as be
<pb facs="tcp:7066:7"/> very perite in their faculties; yet if thy Stable be not every way Å¿it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and correÅ¿pondent, much diÅ¿profit and inconvenience may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Å¿oone redound to thy HorÅ¿e. I have therefore preÅ¿cribed thee the meanes how thou mayeÅ¿t have a perfect and good Stable, with all commodities and accoutrements thereunto belonging: and therefore if thou wilt be pleaÅ¿ed to make uÅ¿e of theÅ¿e my rudiments, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e my grounds and principles, aÅ¿Å¿ure thy Å¿elfe thou wilt in Å¿hort time aÅ¿pire to that which will be thy honour and renown.</p>
            <p>And to the end thou mayeÅ¿t the more perfectly and eaÅ¿ily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand the full drift and Å¿umme of this my firÅ¿t Booke, I will here give unto thee an Epitome of it in a few lines, which may doe thee much pleaÅ¿ure in the peruÅ¿all thereof.</p>
            <p>In the Introduction, I Å¿hew thee how needfull a creature the HorÅ¿e is beyond all others, and what admirable things HorÅ¿es in former times have perpetrated and done, whereof I produce thee inÅ¿tances of the famous acts of Å¿undry brave and generous HorÅ¿es, whoÅ¿e love to their MaÅ¿ters have been Å¿o great great, as hardly to be credited, if ancient HiÅ¿tories and Annals of good integrity, had not engraven them in the memory of never-dying poÅ¿terity. We reade of <hi>Bucepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> what he did for the good, life, and Å¿afety of his MaÅ¿ter; of the HorÅ¿e of <hi>DionyÅ¿ius,</hi> with what undaunted courage he comported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe in battell for the reliefe and Å¿uccour of his Lord; it is recorded alÅ¿o of the HorÅ¿e of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> what ill Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e befell <hi>Centurettus,</hi> who when he had Å¿laine <hi>Antiochus,</hi> would needs backe the HorÅ¿e of his Å¿laine MaÅ¿ter. It is alÅ¿o noted what inly love <hi>Nicomedes</hi> his HorÅ¿e bare to his Lord and MaÅ¿ter, when after his death of meere griefe, famiÅ¿hed himÅ¿elfe. We reade of <hi>Aethon,</hi> the HorÅ¿e of <hi>Pallas,</hi> who was evidently obÅ¿erved and Å¿een to weep at the funerall of his MaÅ¿ter. <hi>Silius</hi> makes report of two famous HorÅ¿es called <hi>Pelorus</hi> and <hi>Ciraeus,</hi> the one eminent for his proweÅ¿Å¿e and hardineÅ¿Å¿e in warre, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his unparalelled Å¿wiftneÅ¿Å¿e. Moreover we may reade, how that this poore creature hath Å¿o well merited of man, as that many have erected Monuments and Sepulchers, celebrated Exequies, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and founded munificent Cities, Å¿et up Pyramidies, made Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs, erected goodly Statues, inÅ¿tituted Playes and Games; and all theÅ¿e in honour of the HorÅ¿e; beÅ¿ides many other remarkable things right worthy of note.</p>
            <p>In the way of Breeding, I do intimate unto thee the manner how, the Å¿eaÅ¿on when, the place where, together with the colours, marks, and Å¿hapes as well of thy Stalions, as of thy Race, or Stud Mares, and from what defects they muÅ¿t be free: what Signes are beÅ¿t wherein to cover, what courÅ¿e to take with them that they may conceive, what exerciÅ¿e is fitteÅ¿t for them as well when they be with Fole, as after foling; how to cheriÅ¿h thy Mares when their Colts Å¿hall runne by them, and how to breed up thy Colts till they come to handling,
<pb facs="tcp:7066:8"/> backing, and riding, with other circumÅ¿tances very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be known: and thus much briefly for the firÅ¿t Book.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd Booke conÅ¿iÅ¿teth chiefly of the manner how thou mayeÅ¿t cure all Å¿uch diÅ¿eaÅ¿es and maladies (both intrinÅ¿ecall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinÅ¿ecall) whereunto either the life of the HorÅ¿e, or any of his limbs or members may be any way endamaged or in danger. This I have handled by way of familiar Dialogue, which I hold to be beÅ¿t, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding of prolix and over-tedious diÅ¿courÅ¿es, by reaÅ¿on it will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much help the memory of the Reader, and keep his minde the better attent upon the Å¿tate of the QueÅ¿tion or Å¿ubject in hand, and by that meanes I may my Å¿elfe be the better able alÅ¿o to explicate and deliver my meaning, much more cleerely. In which Dialogue, I have introduced as prolocutors, three perÅ¿ons onely, <hi>viz.</hi> FirÅ¿t, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophilus</hi> a Gentleman, one who is the true lover of the HorÅ¿e: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Hippiatrus</hi> the Ferrier or MariÅ¿hall, one moÅ¿t expert in HorÅ¿e-leech craft: And thirdly, <hi>HippoÅ¿erus</hi> his Servant or Iourney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Å¿ometimes his apprentice bred up by him, from whom <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erus</hi> hath had his education and knowledge in this Art: theÅ¿e be all the <hi>Dramatis perÅ¿onae</hi> to this Scene. Wherefore in the firÅ¿t Chapter, I doe endeavour to illuÅ¿trate unto thee the true Office of the Ferrier, wherein I do produce an exact examen of his function.</p>
            <p>In the Å¿econd Chapter, I do inculcate as well the cauÅ¿es of health as of Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, wherein I make an abridgement of all thoÅ¿e things which all learned PhyÅ¿itians and Chirurgions (both antient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern do from the grounds and principles of profound PhiloÅ¿ophy) finde to govern and beare rule in the body of the HorÅ¿e, without which he can have no fleÅ¿h, bones, Å¿inewes, bloud, or life it Å¿elfe, wherewith to make up the entire Å¿tructure of an orginall body, and Å¿uch are firÅ¿t the Elements; Å¿econdly, the Humours, thirdly, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculties; fourthly, the inÅ¿trumentall members; fifthly, the Å¿pirits animall; Å¿ixtly, the Å¿pirits vitall; Å¿eventhly, the naturall parts, and Å¿o of the reÅ¿idue. And having Å¿ufficiently diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed all theÅ¿e things in due order and method, I do then Å¿hew thee what meanes we have to preÅ¿erve the HorÅ¿e from all inward diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, which I doe finde to be foure in number, <hi>viz.</hi> By Purge, by Sweat, by Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and by Vomit: and then I do proceed to inculcate unto thee the cauÅ¿es of health and long life, which I do make to be in number twelve, which if thou do well obÅ¿erve, they will redound to thy great utility and profit.</p>
            <p>In the third Chapter I do demonÅ¿trate certaine things moÅ¿t befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Ferrier to know and underÅ¿tand well, before he Å¿hall take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to adminiÅ¿ter: in the handling whereof I do begin firÅ¿t with the foure Elements, anatomizing unto thee their true natures and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and how and where they be Å¿cituate, things moÅ¿t needfull to be known; then I goe along with the two proper Elements, Å¿hewing from whence the Å¿eed and menÅ¿truall bloud is ingendred, then I paÅ¿Å¿e
<pb facs="tcp:7066:8"/> forwards in intreating of the foure Humours, explaining their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and vertues, poynting unto the places of their abode and reÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and what relation and coherence they have unto the foure Complexions, I do alÅ¿o Å¿hew thee what are the two Å¿pirits animall, and the two vitall, their natures vertues, and places of abode and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idence in the body of the HorÅ¿e. After all this I Å¿hew thee, that by duly obÅ¿erving the complexion of the HorÅ¿e thou art to cure, thou mayeÅ¿t thereby the Å¿ooner, better, and with more Å¿ecurity and eaÅ¿e, perfect thy Cure; nay, I goe yet further with thee, in Å¿hewing unto thee an exact way whereby to know by the complexion it Å¿elfe, the diÅ¿eaÅ¿es whereunto the HorÅ¿e is moÅ¿t propenÅ¿e; then I make known what be the cauÅ¿es of the evill diÅ¿poÅ¿itions of the HorÅ¿e, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and begetteth unavoydable infirmity and Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, whereof they be two in number, <hi>viz.</hi> IntrinÅ¿ecall and ExtrinÅ¿ecall, together with a definition of the nature of Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e; and Å¿o I go along in teaching thee the manner how thou oughteÅ¿t to adminiÅ¿ter Å¿uch Drinks, Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, CliÅ¿ters, and Medicines, without any the leaÅ¿t perill to thy HorÅ¿e, as alÅ¿o the time of the day moÅ¿t Å¿uteable to that purpoÅ¿e: and what exerciÅ¿e is moÅ¿t requiÅ¿ite to be had after PhyÅ¿icke or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. And laÅ¿tly I come to touch briefly upon his urine and ordure, whereby to give the rules infallible how to know and underÅ¿tand the true Å¿tate of the body of the HorÅ¿e as well in health as in Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Chapter of this Å¿econd Book, I do begin to handle the Cures in particular, wherein I run a courÅ¿e by my Å¿elfe, which I have not known any before me undertake: for whereas MaÅ¿ter <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devile,</hi> MaÅ¿ter <hi>Markham,</hi> and others, do begin with all the inward diÅ¿eaÅ¿es which are to be cured by way of PhyÅ¿icke, and then with the outward maladies which doe appertain unto Chirurgery; I have thought it much better to take the diÅ¿eaÅ¿es Alphabetically, mixing the extrinÅ¿ecall with the intrinÅ¿ecall, by which meanes they will the Å¿ooner and more eaÅ¿ily be found, and turned unto more readily. And whereÅ¿oever you Å¿hall finde this <g ref="char:cross">â</g> mark inÅ¿erted in the end of any cure, I have Å¿et the Å¿ame there, to let you know that receit to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, and approved for good and certaine, being by my Å¿elfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten practiÅ¿ed and uÅ¿ed. And thoÅ¿e receits that have not the mark, are Å¿uch Cures which I did procure from Å¿undry able Ferriers, whereof I have had no tryall or experience at all, for want of time and means, and therefore dare not avouch or cry them up for mathematicall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they do appear unto me to be probably good, but by reaÅ¿on I have not tryed them, I would not adventure a <hi>probatum,</hi> or <hi>ecce</hi> upon them. NevertheleÅ¿Å¿e if God permit me to reprint, I doubt not but by that time to give them for approved and warrantable, and to adde many more unto them which I have already by me, which I do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to publiÅ¿h at this preÅ¿ent, albeit I do know many of them to be as probably good as any of thoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>In the other Chapters I goe cleane through the whole Alphabet,
<pb facs="tcp:7066:9"/> according to that Method uÅ¿ed in that 4th. Chapter; and therfore let this abÅ¿tract Å¿uffice for the preÅ¿ent. And foraÅ¿much as I have diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿ed the former things of Breeding, &amp;c. in my firÅ¿t Booke: Yet my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not at the firÅ¿t to trench Å¿o deepe into that Å¿ubject, but to Å¿hew principally the <hi>Ferriers</hi> Craft and Art, out of an earneÅ¿t deÅ¿ire I have to excite &amp; Å¿tir up our yong Gentlemen to aÅ¿Å¿ume Å¿ome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a MyÅ¿tery Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary for them to apprehend, or at leaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e to have a glimpÅ¿e of, conÅ¿idering how rare a thing it is to finde a skilfull <hi>Ferrier</hi> among our rurall or Countrey <hi>Smiths.</hi> For if the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility &amp; Gentry of this our Ile of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> did truly know how honourable, and how commendable HorÅ¿emanÅ¿hip were, and how much they are eÅ¿teemed and admired, who are the true profeÅ¿Å¿ours thereof, they would labour more than they now doe, to breed and have good HorÅ¿es; but it much troubleth me to Å¿ee how little eÅ¿teeme Gentlemen now a dayes have thereof. Some HorÅ¿es they have, though not for Menage, yet for Hunting; but what manner of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Fox-hunting forÅ¿ooth, or Harriers which be as fleete as petty Grey-hounds wherewith they do Å¿o much over-Å¿traine the Å¿trength of their poore HorÅ¿es (forcing them over deepe-Fallowes, tough-Clayes, and wet and rough Lands) that albeit thoÅ¿e HorÅ¿es be Å¿trong and able, yet are they Å¿o toyled out therewith, as that when they come home at night, they would pitty the heart of him who loveth a HorÅ¿e, to Å¿ee them Å¿o be mired, blouded, Å¿purred, lamentably Å¿pent, and tyred out: Whereas if Å¿uch HorÅ¿es had beene ridden to the great Saddle and Cannon, they would have infinitely delighted all men who Å¿hould have beheld them.</p>
            <p>But let mee leave them vnto their toyleÅ¿ome Å¿ports, and let my Å¿peech bee directed to Å¿uch Heroique and Generous Spirits, who have a deÅ¿ire to informe and better their underÅ¿tanding in the Å¿ecrets of this brave MyÅ¿terie; who if they have a will to bee edoctrinated therein, then for a Mathematicall ground of true HorÅ¿e-manÅ¿hip, I muÅ¿t tell them, that they having and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing of good HorÅ¿es, yea and Riding it Å¿elf is little worth without the knowledge of the <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Craft, at the leaÅ¿t in the Theorique or Speculative part, if not in the Practique: and therefore I could wiÅ¿h that every worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Å¿hould have a good inÅ¿ight thereinto, albeit he doth not make it his Trade, Occupation; or frequent practiÅ¿e and profeÅ¿Å¿ion. Yet it will not be amiÅ¿Å¿e, he be able to know every diÅ¿eaÅ¿e in a HorÅ¿e, its Symtomes, and how it commeth, together with the true Å¿igne therof, which indeed is a matter of very great conÅ¿equence. For when a Nobleman <hi>(V. G.)</hi> Knight, or Gentleman Å¿hall have a HorÅ¿e that doth well merit his affection, and which Å¿hall be for his turne, if any accident or Malady Å¿hall befall him, albeit he may not himÅ¿elfe take upon him the Cure, and to Drench, Bloudy, or DreÅ¿Å¿e him with his owne hands; yet (Å¿ending for a <hi>Ferrier</hi>) he may diÅ¿courÅ¿e with him upon the Nature of the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e, and thereby come to underÅ¿tand

But hereunto I anÅ¿were, that theÅ¿e Men have no cauÅ¿e at all to feare any preiudice thereby; and I dare boldly affirme the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Bookes will be Å¿o far from their harme or hinderance as that it will be infinitly to their benefit: for when they Å¿hall find any one Nobleman, Knight, or Gentleman who will undergoe Å¿o much paines as eyther to Bloudy, Drench, CoroÅ¿ive, Cauterize, apply CataplaÅ¿ines, EmplayÅ¿ters, Powders, Vnguents, or the like to his HorÅ¿e, whatÅ¿oever he hath attained unto by reading, or otherwiÅ¿e; you Å¿hall have a thouÅ¿and who upon any the leaÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion will Å¿end for a <hi>Ferrier</hi> to take the Cure in hand. Againe, inÅ¿teed of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended preiudice, this commodity will accrew to my brethren <hi>Smiths, MariÅ¿halls,</hi> and <hi>Ferriers, viz.</hi> they Å¿hall (by promulgation of Bookes of this Nature) become much more able, and <hi>Imbui in Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dijs,</hi> that is, much more learned and indoctrinated in this generous Faculty then ever they were before, by which meanes they will bee eÅ¿teemed much more famous and eminent, and cryed up for moÅ¿t expert and able Men in this Noble Science. For how commeth it to paÅ¿Å¿e, that PhyÅ¿itians, Chyrurgions, Lawyers, Divines, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ArtiÅ¿ts doe become Å¿o great Doctors of their Arts and ProfeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, and admired for moÅ¿t famous and learned Men, and Å¿o fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetly Å¿ought after, enquired out, and Å¿ent for when occaÅ¿ion is? Is it not for what they have attained unto by Å¿tudy and reading, untill which time they were not Å¿o hardy as to adventure upon practiÅ¿e? Å¿o as without their Library, they could never have been able to have attained unto that eminent knowledge they have afterwards aÅ¿pired unto; neyther could they otherwiÅ¿e have beene poÅ¿Å¿ibly able to practiÅ¿e and worke by true Art and Science. For the Workes of
<pb facs="tcp:7066:10"/> learned and eminent Men, is the only thing that doth enable them, which are left as a never-dying Monument to enÅ¿uing and endleÅ¿Å¿e PoÅ¿terity, as the common good to the weale publique, even to all enÅ¿uing Ages: Imitating therein the ancient Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> that when any man had invented that thing which was knowne to bee commodious to the Re-publique, leaÅ¿t the thing Å¿hould bee buryed with the Inventer, and by that meanes taked up with him in the aÅ¿hes of perpetuall oblivion: they ordained that the firÅ¿t Inventer Å¿hould Å¿et up his Science be or knowne by way of Record in their publique Schooles in Å¿pacious Tables and in Capitall Characters of gold with with this ImpreÅ¿Å¿e, or Title, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Now if any man Å¿hall Å¿ay, that I have robbed or rifled other mens labours: I anÅ¿were, I have not robbed, but approved them: for by the Å¿ame rule I may as well object, that whoÅ¿oever worketh by my Booke robbeth me, for if that be theft, I pray what PhyÅ¿ition is there in the whole world, (promulgating his Science) may not be as much cenÅ¿ured and accuÅ¿ed for rifling the AphoriÅ¿mes of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi> yea and of others the Ancients and Moderne Authours alÅ¿o.

            <p>Now the reaÅ¿on why I did enterlace my firÅ¿t Book with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and perfections which HorÅ¿es in former times have atchieved,

            <p>If therefore it may pleaÅ¿e thee Å¿ometimes to retire thy Å¿elfe in the peruÅ¿all of this TreatiÅ¿e, and with due and Å¿erious judgement, not Å¿o much to reflect upon the method and forme of this world, as of the matter or Å¿ubject it Å¿elfe, then I doubt not but that thou wilt receive Å¿uch benefit and contentment, as that thereby thou wilt be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and enabled in thy underhanding, both for the breeding and well ordering of young HorÅ¿es, and in the cure of every of their maladies.</p>
            <p>And foraÅ¿much as I have brought this my firÅ¿t work to its period, which I may rightly reÅ¿emble to a Structure or Building, my Å¿peci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care hath been to make it faire and beautifull to the eye, and to grace, garniÅ¿h, and Å¿et it forth with varieties of divers Å¿orts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have been very diligent to give it all Å¿atisfaction I have been able, and therefore I have laboured to paint and poliÅ¿h it forth with what variety is moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary for Å¿o exquiÅ¿ite a building.</p>
            <p>LaÅ¿tly, Å¿ithence nothing more imports a building, then to lay a Å¿ure and Å¿ubÅ¿tantiall foundation, and withall to make the wals Å¿o tite and impregnable, as to be able to reÅ¿iÅ¿t not Å¿o much winde and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the violence, aÅ¿Å¿aults, and battery of detracting enemies: my care therefore hath been to have it founded and Å¿cituate upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Rock of a pregnant truth. And therrfore conÅ¿idering I have applyed all this paines, and Å¿pent Å¿o much time and coÅ¿t, which I might have otherwiÅ¿e both imployed and applyed to my more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commodity, by which I have not onely finiÅ¿hed this Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and made it commodious for thee, but I do alÅ¿o preÅ¿ent it unto thee meerely for thy proper uÅ¿e and habitation; and therefore I hope that thou wilt not make Å¿uch uÅ¿e thereof, as men do of an Inne, where he taketh a bait or repaÅ¿t, for one meale, or for a lodging, for one night, and away, to wit, by onely taking a Å¿uperficiall view thereof: but that thou wilt make it thy abode, at the leaÅ¿t for Å¿ome time; I meane, by reading and digeÅ¿ting the whole worke in order as it lyeth treatably and Å¿eriouÅ¿ly, and after by putting in practiÅ¿e what therein thou Å¿halt finde to be fit for thy uÅ¿e; Å¿o Å¿halt thou reape, and enjoy the benefit; my Å¿elfe the comfort, and the Common-wealth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>If any leakes be in the printing, impute them either unto the miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿ion of the Printer, or elÅ¿e to the negligence of him unto whom
<pb facs="tcp:7066:11"/> the charge of the correcting was committed; and if any be in the Author, let the fault light upon thoÅ¿e who Å¿purred him Å¿o faÅ¿t on to haÅ¿te it to the PreÅ¿Å¿e; but howÅ¿oever Å¿hew thy charity in correcting the faults and Å¿lips, as well of the one, as of the other: So Å¿halt thou Å¿hew thy Å¿elfe to the world like thy Å¿elfe, truely Noble, and oblige the Author to remaine ever thy humble Servant, and true Friend: Farewell.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we will but take to our Å¿erious conÅ¿ideration how many great obligations we have to admire the infinite goodneÅ¿Å¿e of Almighty God in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Å¿uch a marvellous number of creatures, meerely for the uÅ¿e and Å¿ervice of man, whereof no one of them can be wanting; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t them all, we have none more uÅ¿efull, or which can be leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿pared, then the HorÅ¿e; no dumb creature more generous, nor any that commeth Å¿o neere unto the pleaÅ¿ure of man, none can Å¿erve him better in time of peace and warre, none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for manuring and tilling the earth, and to cauÅ¿e it to produce its fruits; none more uÅ¿efull for bringing in the fruits of the earth; none more behoofefull to beare and carry him his long and tedious jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, in heat and cold, through thick and thin, by night and day; none better to carry him from danger, and to land his maÅ¿ter at the port of Å¿afety, then the HorÅ¿e: and for his paÅ¿times and recreations, no creature to be compared to this: neither is there any creature created by the great Creator of all things, which doth Å¿o perfectly underÅ¿tand and connive with the nature and minde of man, or that beareth a more inly love to man, as doth this poore creature the HorÅ¿e; for upon all occaÅ¿ions he Å¿weateth, he trudgeth, he toyleth, he drudgeth, he moyleth, he laboureth <hi>pro viribus,</hi> with great alacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty and cheerefulneÅ¿Å¿e (Å¿o long as his vitall Å¿pirits laÅ¿t) to give com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and content to him that feedeth and cheriÅ¿heth him, yea and that (I Å¿ay) with Å¿uch joy and alacrity, as if (like to a reaÅ¿onable creature) he found himÅ¿elfe obliged thereto in the bond of all Å¿incere duty and gratitude. For Å¿hould I Å¿peake rather like a PhiloÅ¿opher then a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian, I could not but agnize nature to be admirable in all her works,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7066:16"/> wherein man doth owe unto her infinite, and thoÅ¿e very great thanks, in that Å¿he hath accommodated and plentifully furniÅ¿hed him with all things needfull for his uÅ¿e, as alÅ¿o in that Å¿he hath propagated (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t all other) the HorÅ¿e, the moÅ¿t uÅ¿efull for the Å¿ervice of man, and who beÅ¿t acknowledgeth his MaÅ¿ter. And that this may be the better anatomized, I will Å¿hew you what I finde recorded by authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Authors of the excellency of this praiÅ¿e-worthy creature.</p>
               <p>The Å¿o much-renowned <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> who carried his MaÅ¿ter through Å¿o many conquered kingdomes, Å¿erves for an example to all enÅ¿uing ages, who would not Å¿uffer any man but great <hi>Alexander</hi> to backe him, who Å¿eemed to be proud at what time he carried Å¿o glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and victorious a charge, and it is alÅ¿o written of him, that being wounded at the Å¿iege and Å¿acking of <hi>Thebes,</hi> he carried him couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿ly through the troops and throngs of all the combatants, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible valour and courage, nothing at all eÅ¿teeming or prizing the loÅ¿Å¿e of his bloud, being moÅ¿t deÅ¿irous, and no leÅ¿Å¿e willing to do his maÅ¿ter all faithfull Å¿ervice, to the utmoÅ¿t of his power, and to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion of the laÅ¿t drop of his bloud, labouring to purchaÅ¿e unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe by his (not to be parallelled) valour, and his reÅ¿olute perÅ¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, a victorious advantage over the enemy. What never-dying high renown, the horÅ¿e of <hi>CaeÅ¿ar</hi> got, I hold little inferiour to that of <hi>Bucephalus? DionyÅ¿ius</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Sicily,</hi> in a great and well fought battell, was himÅ¿elfe Å¿o hard put to it, that he was conÅ¿trained to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ake his horÅ¿e, nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e the poore beaÅ¿t made his way through the throngs of the enemy; who all bloudy and miery as he was, gat him to a randevous his Stable. <hi>Centaurettus</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> having in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile flaine <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he in a bravado mounted his horÅ¿e, who Å¿oone found by good experience, (albeit no whit to his advantage) that the Å¿aid horÅ¿e retained a reÅ¿entment of the death of his Å¿laine MaÅ¿ter, for the horÅ¿e Å¿o Å¿oone as he felt this his new Lord upon his back, never gave ouer flinging, yarking, plunging, and bownding, commanding the Bit with his teeth, launching out Å¿ometimes this way, Å¿ometimes that way, with Å¿o great impetuoÅ¿ity and fury, that at length he caÅ¿t his raÅ¿h rider to the earth, and then fell to him with his heeles, redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his Å¿trokes in Å¿o thick and violent a manner, not giving over till he had Å¿lain him out-right, whereby he gave him little cauÅ¿e to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and glory in his temerarious attempt. We reade of <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> whoÅ¿e HorÅ¿e Å¿o intirely loved him, as that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter was no Å¿ooner dead, but the HorÅ¿e preÅ¿ently forÅ¿ooke his meat, and Å¿o continued, untill Å¿uch time as he languiÅ¿hing for very griefe, dyed of famine. <hi>Virgil,</hi> the Prince of Poets, maketh honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aethon,</hi> the HorÅ¿e of <hi>Pallas,</hi> Å¿onne of <hi>Evander,</hi> who Å¿aith that this <hi>Aethon</hi> being preÅ¿ent at the funerall of his maÅ¿ter, wept for Å¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as theÅ¿e two verÅ¿es do inculcate:

                     <l>After came <hi>Aethon,</hi> bold in fight, now weeping,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silius Italicus</hi> in his ninth Book, doth highly extoll two horÅ¿es, to wit, <hi>Pelorus</hi> and <hi>Ciraeus,</hi> Å¿peaking of them in this manner:
<q>
                     <l>Ready <hi>Pelorus</hi> was to th' hand and rayne,</l>
                     <l>Obedient Å¿till, and of a generous Å¿traine:</l>
                     <l>Hearing his MaÅ¿ters voyce, <hi>Ciraeus</hi> hies,</l>
                     <l>'Fore the beholders, and the winde of flies.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The tractableneÅ¿Å¿e and love that the HorÅ¿e beareth to man, have been the occaÅ¿ion that Å¿undry great perÅ¿onages have reciprocally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wered it, by erecting of Statues, and by building of moÅ¿t famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their honour and memory. <hi>Alexander</hi> before mentioned, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an opulent City in honour of <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> and gave it his name, and celebrated his exequies. The Egyptians erected moÅ¿t magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Piramides, and Å¿umptuous Å¿epulchres to Å¿uch horÅ¿es, as had Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them well in their warres. <hi>Octavius CaeÅ¿ar,</hi> and after him, <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, interred their HorÅ¿es with great pomp and Å¿olemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and cauÅ¿ed famous Epitaphs to be engraven upon their monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Emperour <hi>Commodus,</hi> did the like to his HorÅ¿e <hi>ParÅ¿inus,</hi> and commanded that he Å¿hould be buried in the <hi>Vatican. Romulus</hi> did inÅ¿titute Playes and Games called <hi>Equitiae,</hi> in honour of HorÅ¿es, and cauÅ¿ed them to be preÅ¿ented in the field of <hi>Mars.</hi> The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> did Å¿o highly eÅ¿teem of theÅ¿e noble creatures, as that they armed their Helmets with the skins of HorÅ¿es, Å¿uffering their eares to remain on, and they did weare their tayles upon their CreÅ¿ts, like as now a daies men uÅ¿e their plumes. Other nations have done the like, who held HorÅ¿es in no little eÅ¿teem. We reade of a Roman Emperour, who made his HorÅ¿e a Senator. The ancient AÅ¿trologers have likewiÅ¿e at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed Å¿o much to HorÅ¿es, that they have placed one winged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t the coeleÅ¿tiall Å¿ignes. The Poets hold that the Fountaine (where the nine MuÅ¿es uÅ¿ed to bath themÅ¿elves, and to drink) Å¿prang up, by the blow of the foot which <hi>PegaÅ¿us</hi> gave againÅ¿t the two topt hill, <hi>ParnaÅ¿Å¿us. Neptune,</hi> God of the Sea, is Å¿urnamed <hi>Hippius;</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on that (as the Poets doe fable) the firÅ¿t HorÅ¿e that was ever Å¿een, received his origen from him, or from a Å¿tone whereon <hi>Neptune</hi> had poured water. There remaineth much more to be Å¿aid in honour of the HorÅ¿e, then their hath been already delivered. Wherefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting further Encomiums, and attributes, I haÅ¿ten to matters of greater conÅ¿equence. Sithence therefore the caÅ¿e Å¿o Å¿tandeth, that this dumb creature is by Almighty God given unto man, as a creature of Å¿o uÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full importance, what thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e then are we bound to give unto him for Å¿o great a bleÅ¿Å¿ing and benefit? And therefore what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7066:17"/> is required of us; yea, and what carefulneÅ¿Å¿e ought we to uÅ¿e, in travelling to attaine to this Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary a creature in the moÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act manner we are able? Nor can this poÅ¿Å¿ibly be acquired to our true content, unleÅ¿Å¿e we doe apply our beÅ¿t endeavours herein; for the Ancients have this Proverb, <hi>All rare and excellent things are hard to compaÅ¿Å¿e:</hi> and therefore we ought to apply all care and induÅ¿try to attain unto good HorÅ¿es, which can never be Å¿o well done, as by <hi>breeding</hi> them; for they muÅ¿t be the HorÅ¿es that will be able beÅ¿t to Å¿erve us in thoÅ¿e offices whereunto we Å¿hall intend them, according as hereafter Å¿hall be moÅ¿t exactly illuÅ¿trated.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the beÅ¿t manner of breeding.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are Å¿o many diverÅ¿ities of opinions Å¿o mainly defended <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> that maketh men fearefull to bring that to publique view, which long practice and experience hath brought them to know and underÅ¿tand to be moÅ¿t true and infallible: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleÅ¿Å¿e I preÅ¿uming that the more judicious may peradventure favour my reaÅ¿ons and grounds; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them at leaÅ¿t for probable and good, if they Å¿hall adventure to make triall, which if they be pleaÅ¿ed Å¿o to do, I am confident they will both allow and approve of this my manner of <hi>breeding,</hi> above all other wayes heretofore practiÅ¿ed; who finding it to be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will never be brought from the Å¿ame method, and therefore I would not have any man to condemne me before he Å¿hall firÅ¿t have made triall.</p>
               <p>My counÅ¿ell therefore is, that Å¿uch generous Å¿pirits, unto whom Almighty God hath extended his benigne hand, would take to their conÅ¿ideration, how needfull a thing it is for them to lay hold upon this Å¿o noble and profitable a bleÅ¿Å¿ing and benefit, by applying their beÅ¿t care and diligence to breed, good, able, and Å¿erviceable HorÅ¿es, which may be as eaÅ¿ily performed, and in a manner with as little coÅ¿t, as in breeding Iades and Baffles, unuÅ¿efull and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For by procuring a good and able Stud of choice Mares, and by endeavouring to get Å¿elect Stallions, which for mettle, Å¿pirit, Å¿hape, colour, marks, and the like, Å¿hall be known to be rightly bred, and truely generous, as well (I Å¿ay) the Mares as the Stallions; and theÅ¿e, young, handÅ¿ome, of Å¿ize indifferent, that is, neither too Å¿mall, nor too large, long-legged or under-bodied; but well knit, limb'd, and joynted; it will be beyond all peradventure but that you Å¿hall have HorÅ¿es fit wherewith to Å¿erve your Country upon all occaÅ¿ions, and your own turn and your friends, and acquire to your Å¿elfe no Å¿mall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7066:17"/> honour and commendations both from your Prince, and the weale publique. And this the better to bee performed, you muÅ¿t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand that Å¿ome things are neceÅ¿Å¿ary to be conÅ¿idered. FirÅ¿t, that your grounds be fit for <hi>breeding,</hi> and thoÅ¿e not to be Å¿uch as be low, wet, fenny, mooriÅ¿h, or mariÅ¿h; but they muÅ¿t be paÅ¿tures upland, hilly, and in Å¿ome places Å¿tony and rocky, for grounds of this nature are very profitable for your Colts, to Å¿cope, run, and play in, it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth their winde, it knitteth their joynts, and hardeneth and maketh tough their hooves: Å¿ome of your grounds ought alÅ¿o not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Underwoods, BuÅ¿hes, FurÅ¿ells, Broome, and the like; theÅ¿e will Å¿erve for Å¿helter at what time the cold windes doe blow: the reÅ¿idue of your grounds ought to have Lawnes and Plains, wherein Å¿hould be better graÅ¿Å¿e then the former; and in theÅ¿e Lawnes, is needfull there Å¿hould be great Oakes, and Å¿uch like timber-trees for them whereby to Å¿helter them from the Å¿corching Å¿unne in the extreame heats, eÅ¿pecially during the time of the Canicular dayes; and theÅ¿e trees will alÅ¿o defend them from the buzzing and Å¿tinging Fly, which otherwiÅ¿e would greatly annoy and afflict them: you muÅ¿t alÅ¿o ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate your grounds with partitions convenient, as well for change, which Å¿ometimes is moÅ¿t requiÅ¿ite, as alÅ¿o whereby to Å¿egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate each Å¿ort of cattell by it Å¿elf; as your young and old, raÅ¿e or bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Mares by themÅ¿elves, your weanlings by themÅ¿elves, your Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes by themÅ¿elves, and your Å¿toned Colts by themÅ¿elves, according as your beÅ¿t judgement Å¿hall dictate; otherwiÅ¿e your breed will be in confuÅ¿ion, and come to nothing, and Å¿o you may run the hazard, to loÅ¿e both your coÅ¿t and paines. Places muÅ¿t be alÅ¿o made apart, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both your Mares with fole, and thoÅ¿e who have their Colts Å¿uck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, may run by themÅ¿elves with all quietneÅ¿Å¿e and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneÅ¿Å¿e; and every of theÅ¿e partitions muÅ¿t be Å¿o Å¿ufficiently fenced, as that no one Å¿ort of cattell can breake into the other. And I doe yet further adviÅ¿e, that theÅ¿e grounds be well furniÅ¿hed with Å¿weet and wholeÅ¿ome water, whereof ought not to be any want, either in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Å¿ummer, for otherwiÅ¿e you may endanger the tainting and Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting of them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, that certaine Sheds and Hay-houÅ¿es be erected for them to be fed in during the time of the winter, when graÅ¿Å¿e is Å¿canty and not Å¿o much nouriÅ¿hing, and the cold winds, froÅ¿ts, raines, and Å¿nowes, may greatly pinch and annoy them; in which houÅ¿ings, would be Å¿et up Rackes and Mangers whereat to feed them; there would alÅ¿o be laid cleane Å¿traw for them to lye upon, which will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much comfort and keep them warm: But above all, the greateÅ¿t care muÅ¿t be had to the fences in generall, whether wall (which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore the beÅ¿t) pale, quickÅ¿ets, broad ditches, or high banks, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould at any time breake forth, and treÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿e your neighbours to baÅ¿tardize, and wrong your breed: and you ought alÅ¿o to inÅ¿titute a truÅ¿ty and diligent Bayliffe or Å¿ervant, whoÅ¿e onely function Å¿hould
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7066:18"/> be to make his fence-walke morning and evening, as duly as any wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Keeper or Wood-man doth his Pale-walke, to Å¿ee that the fences be faÅ¿t, and his cattell Å¿afe: and let him not faile every day once at the leaÅ¿t, to take a true tale and inventary of every Å¿ort of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell he hath in his Å¿everall grounds, for feare any Å¿hould be miÅ¿Å¿ing, or Å¿ome misfortune befalne any of them; and it hee Å¿hall finde any wanting, let him not reÅ¿t Å¿earching, untill he hath found it; and if it be in danger or Å¿icke, let him not give over himÅ¿elfe if he can, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e let him haÅ¿te to call company and Å¿trength enough) to free it out of harmes way.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the grounds themÅ¿elves, as I would not have them too rich, or too rank and deep with graÅ¿Å¿e; Å¿o muÅ¿t they not be too barren, Å¿hort, and moÅ¿Å¿ie; for as well in this Å¿ubject, as in all other things, the golden meane is evermore to be preferred. Having thus provided your Å¿elfe of a Stud of the choiceÅ¿t and ableÅ¿t Mares, for age, colour, Å¿hape, and marks, your Stallions alÅ¿o of like attributes your care muÅ¿t be to Å¿ee your Mares well covered, for in this chiefly conÅ¿iÅ¿teth the life and quinteÅ¿Å¿ence of your <hi>breeding.</hi> Be you therefore marvellous carefull, that neither your Stallion or Mare, have any of theÅ¿e enÅ¿uing defects; <hi>viz.</hi> neither Moon-eyes, watry-eyes, or Bloud-Å¿hotten-eyes, or other defect in their eyes or Å¿ight, no taint in their wind by Glanders or otherwiÅ¿e, no way Å¿ubject to Mainge, Mallen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Sellender, Splents, Spaven, Curb, Ring-bone, Scratches, Kybed-heeles, or any other the like Å¿orances; that they be not Cock-throp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but their Throples very looÅ¿e; for let either Stallion or Mare have any of theÅ¿e maladies, then be you well aÅ¿Å¿ured their Colts will take them as hereditary from their Parents: inÅ¿omuch as when you eÅ¿teem your Å¿elfe confident of Å¿uch young HorÅ¿es, you Å¿o much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ired to be maÅ¿ter of, you will be miÅ¿taken; for inÅ¿tead of a Stirrier or HorÅ¿e for mannage, you have bred him fit for nought elÅ¿e but the plough; and in the place of a Hunter, he proves a Mil-horÅ¿e; and in hope you had a HorÅ¿e for a CourÅ¿e, he proves for no better uÅ¿e but the Cart; and him you deÅ¿ire to have for your own Pad-Å¿addle, you will be conÅ¿trained to Å¿ell him to a Carrier, to beare a Pack-Å¿addle with a burthen.</p>
               <p>To come to intreat of the time moÅ¿t fitting for covering your Mares, let that be Å¿o done, that they may caÅ¿t their Foles in the dead of winter; as either in December, or Ianuary: for during their time of going with Fole, to wit, from the day of their Covering, unto that of their Foling, is commonly 12 months, and 10 dayes; yet Å¿ome do aver, they doe want 11 dayes of 12 moneths, of which computation there is juÅ¿t three weeks oddes: others againe doe affirme, that a Mare goeth but only 11. months and 10 dayes, wherein is greater oddes: but I have found it to be a moÅ¿t certain rule which never did faile me (unleÅ¿Å¿e in a yong Mare upon her firÅ¿t Colt, who will want Å¿ome few dayes of the ordinary account) and long and frequent experience
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7066:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath made me to be very perfect, that a Mare goeth (unleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿ome miÅ¿chance or other accident hath otherwiÅ¿e occaÅ¿ioned) twelve mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths and ten dayes: for when at any time I have been preÅ¿ent when a Mare hath been covered, I have in the very minute entred into my Almanacke, the very day and houre in which Å¿he tooke the HorÅ¿e; and becauÅ¿e I would not be deceived, I have been preÅ¿ent at her fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and I have found the time never to faile me. And therefore I could wiÅ¿h all <hi>breeders</hi> to obÅ¿erve with me the Å¿ame courÅ¿e, and they Å¿hall finde this account to fall out juÅ¿t as I have delivered. If your Mare be covered about S. <hi>Lucies</hi> day, which is the 13 of December, then will Å¿he fole about S. <hi>Thomas</hi> day the Å¿ame month in the yeare following: But before you Å¿uffer her to be covered, let neither the Stallion or Mare be at graÅ¿Å¿e, but taken into the houÅ¿e, Å¿ixe weekes or a moneth at the leaÅ¿t; during which time, let them be both very well fed with good old Hay and Oates well duÅ¿ted and Å¿ifted, to the end they may have Å¿trength and Å¿eed to performe the office for which you have them. But if you will have your Mare certainly to conceive, then take bloud from both Å¿ides of her necke, and let her bleed at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veine well nigh a quart; which muÅ¿t be done five or Å¿ixe dayes before Å¿he is to be covered; and the next day after her bleeding, give her in a quart of new milke, halfe a iij. of ArtimeÅ¿ia, <hi>alias</hi> Mugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, chopped very Å¿mall, a piece of Å¿weet Butter, and â¥ 2. of <hi>London</hi> Treacle warm; all theÅ¿e put upon the fire till the Butter and Treacle be diÅ¿Å¿olved, and give this to the Mare bloud-warme in the morning faÅ¿ting, and Å¿o the next morning again, and let her drinke be white water. This drink is moÅ¿t Å¿overaigne to cauÅ¿e conception, it provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Å¿eed abundantly, it openeth the pores in the body, and cauÅ¿eth the Mare to keep the Å¿eed Å¿he receiveth from the Stallion; Moreover this drinke comforteth the womb and matrix very much: Å¿o as it is great oddes but that Å¿he being thus ordered, will be Å¿ped and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, unleÅ¿Å¿e Å¿he be a Mare of great Å¿terility, which Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, Å¿he is not to be kept for a race or breeding Mare.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if you be deÅ¿irous to have your Mare to conceive a HorÅ¿e-colt, rather then a Filly; obÅ¿erve then this leÅ¿Å¿on I Å¿hall here give you, and you Å¿hall finde it an infallible rule, which will never miÅ¿Å¿e, <hi>viz.</hi> At what time you would have your Mare to be covered, Let it be done, when one of the firÅ¿t five maÅ¿culine Signes do raign, which are either <hi>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,</hi> or <hi>Leo;</hi> but if Å¿he Å¿hall be covered when any of the Feminine or watery Signes are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, as <hi>Virgo, Libra Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius,</hi> or <hi>PiÅ¿ces;</hi> then be you confident it will be a Filly. For this have I often tryed, and found it Å¿eldome or never to faile me, eÅ¿pecially if the wind be either WeÅ¿t or North (but WeÅ¿t is beÅ¿t) at the time of her covering, and you will finde this my rule to be moÅ¿t infallible, for experience hath taught it me: And <hi>I have attained unto more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by experience, then I was ever able to aÅ¿pire unto, either by reading
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7066:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> and Å¿tudy, or by hearing what others have dictated, taught, or told mee:</hi> For we have a maxime, <hi>Experience is the beÅ¿t and ableÅ¿t miÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e and moderatrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the manner of the covering of your Mares, let her be brought into Å¿ome place abroad, and there faÅ¿tned to Å¿ome Å¿trong poÅ¿t; then bring out to her Å¿ome Å¿toned Iade firÅ¿t to dally with her, and he will provoke her to an aptitude and deÅ¿ire of coity; which done, let the Stallion be led forth towards her, betwixt two or more luÅ¿ty Å¿trong men who may be able to maÅ¿ter him if he Å¿hould prove unruly, and let him leap her; and let this be done in a morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times faÅ¿ting; which done, another man Å¿tanding by with a paile of cold water ready in his hand, in the very time when the HorÅ¿e is diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting, let him caÅ¿t the cold water upon her Å¿hape; which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of the coldneÅ¿Å¿e, the Å¿trength of the caÅ¿ter, and the Å¿uddenneÅ¿Å¿e thereof, will cauÅ¿e her to Å¿hrinke in, and truÅ¿Å¿e up her body, and it will be the meanes to make her retaine the Å¿eed in the matrix, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e the womb would not peradventure Å¿o Å¿oone encloÅ¿e it, but for Å¿ome time after, howÅ¿oever the womb would draw together, but not Å¿o Å¿uddenly, whereby upon the Mares motion, there might be Å¿ome danger of diÅ¿Å¿olving. Take then away the Stallion, and let the Mare be put into Å¿ome remote place alone, from Å¿ight and hearing of other HorÅ¿es and Mares, but let her neither eate nor drinke in foure hours after, neither let her have any water at all till night, and then give her either a Å¿weet MaÅ¿h, or white water. After Å¿he hath been thus Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you Å¿hall know whether or not Å¿he hath either conceived, or loÅ¿t, or caÅ¿t her Å¿eed, by many evident Å¿ymptomes which will appeare to your eye; for if Å¿he retaineth a good Å¿tomacke to her meat, and Å¿o continueth, if Å¿he doe not neigh at hearing or Å¿ight of other horÅ¿es, if Å¿he do not piÅ¿Å¿e oft times in the day, caÅ¿teth not her eye about gazing continually at every noiÅ¿e Å¿he heareth, pricketh not up her eares, and that in three or foure daies after her Covering, her belly Å¿eemeth to be more gaunt, her hayre more Å¿licke and cloÅ¿e to her skin, Å¿hewing of a brighter colour, and Å¿he Å¿eemeth to fall away and become leane: if (I Å¿ay) any of theÅ¿e Symptomes doe appeare in her, then is it an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Å¿igne Å¿he hath kept her Å¿eed and conceiveth, but if the contrary appeare in her, then hath Å¿he loÅ¿t it, and engendreth not.</p>
               <p>But as for offering her the HorÅ¿e againe ten dayes after, together with Å¿uch like circumÅ¿tances, I hold them impertinent for this place, being Å¿o frequently knowne and practiÅ¿ed, and therefore my labour may well be Å¿pared. But for her keeping and ordring after her Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, let her not drinke that Å¿he deÅ¿ireth, but continue her with the Å¿ame dyet which formerly Å¿he had before her covering for three weeks or a month after, leÅ¿t the Å¿eed might fortune to be impaired, before the Colt be Å¿ufficiently formed in the womb, and let her be kept Å¿weet and cleane as may be, and that without any labour or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciÅ¿e during that three weeks or moneth: after which terme you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7066:19"/> may if you pleaÅ¿e, inure her to moderate labour, wherein have a Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of foure things: firÅ¿t, that Å¿he be not at any time gallopped, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or run off from her wind: Å¿econdly, that Å¿he be not put to carry hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> burthens: thirdly, that Å¿he be neither laboured or travelled in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heat: And laÅ¿tly, that her exerciÅ¿e be not Å¿uch which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> her to Å¿weat violently, for every of theÅ¿e things will cauÅ¿e her to miÅ¿carry.</p>
               <p>Shee being thus with fole: Å¿hee muÅ¿t bee kept in the houÅ¿e untill mid-May at leaÅ¿t, and then let firÅ¿t her Å¿hooes be taken off, her feet pared well, the FruÅ¿h and heeles opened, and plates after the manner of running Å¿hooes (but not to come home to the heeles) Å¿et on; let her run in the drieÅ¿t ground you have, yet not Å¿o Å¿hort of graÅ¿Å¿e, but that Å¿he may at her eaÅ¿e fill her belly at leaÅ¿t once a day, and about the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of September, (if not before) let her be very carefully taken into the houÅ¿e, but Å¿o quietly that you Å¿hall not endanger the hurting of her belly, either by the ruÅ¿hing of other HorÅ¿es and Mares againÅ¿t her, or through her unruly leaping, or inconÅ¿iderate bruÅ¿hing againÅ¿t poÅ¿ts, dores, or the like. Let her be kept thus in the houÅ¿e to the time of her foling, and long after, and let her dyet be as before is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed.</p>
               <p>And when the time of her foling approacheth, let her keeper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend carefully upon her, putting her into a houÅ¿e convenient for her, unhaltred and untied, leÅ¿t in foling, the colt receive domage, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on that Mares doe commonly caÅ¿t their foles Å¿tanding: wherefore let not the roome whereinto you put her, be too Å¿treight, but very warme, (for warmth is a great comfort as well to Mares with fole, as in foling) and let good Å¿tore of Å¿traw be layed, that the Fole may fall from the Mare the Å¿ofter, and be in leÅ¿Å¿e danger of harm, and let her (I Å¿ay) be watched for feare the Fole come not right; and Å¿o Å¿oone as Å¿he hath foled and licked it dry, let her keeper preÅ¿ently milke and Å¿troake her, and that before the Colt doe Å¿ucke her, which will both cauÅ¿e her to give down her milke, making the Å¿ame to multiply, and alÅ¿o keep the Vdder that the milke doe not clod, which if it Å¿hould doe, the Mare might happily in Å¿hort time become dry, whereof if there be any perill, I then adviÅ¿e you to draw as much milke from her as you can; and boyle it with the leaves of Lavender, or Spike, and Å¿o bathe her Vdder therwith warme, continuing Å¿o daily to doe, untill by this meanes you have broken the curd, knobs, and knots, cauÅ¿ing them to be diÅ¿Å¿olved. And as for the water which Å¿he is to drinke for Å¿ome time after her foling, let it be either Å¿weet MaÅ¿hes, or white water, &amp; a moneth after her foling, give her a MaÅ¿h, putting thereinto the powder of BrimÅ¿tone, or Savin, or the like, which will be a great preÅ¿ervation of the Colt; &amp; then if Å¿he be moderately laboured either at Plough or Harrow, if Å¿he will draw, as well the Mare as Colt will proÅ¿per the better; provided Å¿he be kept from raw meat while Å¿he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the Stable, by which meanes Å¿he will the Å¿ooner recover
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7066:20"/> Å¿trength, luÅ¿t, and courage, and have Å¿tore of good milke, which will cauÅ¿e the Colt to thrive the better, and to grow to be of the greater bone, which above all things is a matter of greateÅ¿t conÅ¿equence. And that you Å¿uffer not the Colt to Å¿ucke the Mare when Å¿he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from worke, untill Å¿he be throughly cold, leÅ¿t thereby you Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet the Colt.</p>
               <p>Thus much I have thought fit to handle of this Å¿ubject; and albeit I have laboured herein to attaine to brevity, nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e the premiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es well conÅ¿idered, I Å¿hall not greatly offend in prolixity, howÅ¿oever this my manner of <hi>breeding</hi> being different from the old received cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tomes, will not (I doe aÅ¿Å¿ure me) paÅ¿Å¿e voyd of cenÅ¿ure.

FirÅ¿t therefore your Stable Å¿hould be Å¿citu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate where the ayre is wholeÅ¿ome, pure, and good, and the ground dry: the Å¿tructure would be either of free Stone or Bricke, but Bricke is beÅ¿t, moÅ¿t wholeÅ¿ome and warmeÅ¿t: beÅ¿ides this benefit Brick hath, which Stone hath not, of being very dry, for Stone will weep, and Å¿weat drops of water againÅ¿t raine and miÅ¿ty weather, which begetteth damps, and cauÅ¿eth rhumes in HorÅ¿es. Your Stable ought not to have any unÅ¿avory Gutter, Channell, or Sinke neare to it; no Iakes, HogÅ¿ties, or Hen-rouÅ¿t, whereby to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy it. It would be alÅ¿o Å¿eeled over head, and have Å¿trong doores, with lockes, bolts, and barres unto it. The Racke would not be made too high, or too low, but placed in an indifferent proportion, and Å¿o artificially Å¿et, that neither the duÅ¿t or hay-Å¿eeds may fall into his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7066:20"/> Mane, or upon his necke and face. The Manger would be Å¿et at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different height, made deep, and of one entire piece, as well for Å¿trength, as for conveniency to be kept Å¿weet and cleane. Let the flore be pitched with Flint, and not planked. The windowes would be made with handÅ¿ome Å¿huts and caÅ¿ements, and well glazed, as well to keep out cold and wind, as alÅ¿o (when there may be cauÅ¿e) to let in the coole and freÅ¿h ayre. Againe, take heed there be no lome wall or plaiÅ¿ter, Å¿o neare as that the HorÅ¿e may reach thereto with bis mouth: for upon that he will gnaw, which may doe him much prejudice, and be the cauÅ¿e of much dangerous Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e, for Lome and Lime are Å¿uffocating things, they will infect and putrifie the bloud, endanger the Lounges, and be no friend to his winde: neither Å¿uffer any dung to lye neare him. Furthermore there would be made a faire Loft wherein to lay Hay, and convenient lodging chambers for your Groomes, whoÅ¿e neareneÅ¿Å¿e, together with their care and vigilancy might prevent many dangers and inconveniences which may accrue unto your HorÅ¿es by night. AlÅ¿o let a neat Saddle-houÅ¿e be contrived with Bings for Provender, and in it PreÅ¿Å¿es, wherein to lay up the Saddles, Bridles, and all other furniture appertaining to Horfes, and an Aqua-duct wherewith to bring water to the Stable. And laÅ¿tly, other Stals would be erected remote, wherein upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion to Å¿ever the Å¿icke from the Å¿ound. Many other accoutrements there are belonging to a perfect Stable, as partitions with boards, poÅ¿ts, and barres, with pins driven into every poÅ¿t, whereon to hang Bridles and the like; Å¿helves alÅ¿o faÅ¿tned to the wall Å¿erving for many uÅ¿es, to place neceÅ¿Å¿aries upon, &amp;c. which being known to all men, will be needleÅ¿Å¿e for me here to repeate.</p>
               <p>But you may peradventure Å¿tartle at paving, rather then planking your flore, preferring planks as warmer, and much better then flint or a pitched flore can be; as alÅ¿o for that it is a new thing, little pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiÅ¿ed, and Å¿eldome heard.</p>
               <p>But give me leave (I pray) a little to inform your underÅ¿tanding in this one point, by which means your judgement may fortune to be much bettered. FirÅ¿t therefore, whereas novelty may be objected, I Å¿hall moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ily aÅ¿Å¿oile that point, even from the Å¿elfe-Å¿ame ground in the civill Law, which I inÅ¿erted in the concluÅ¿ion of the precedent chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That things found to be prejudiciall, ought to be inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, although they might be thought needfull, and good in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known times.

I doe therefore affirme, that if your Groome have a care to litter his horÅ¿e well, Å¿o as he may lye Å¿oft and warme, (which is a prime property appertaining to his office) your horÅ¿e will then proÅ¿per, and like much better upon a pitched flore, then he can upon a planked; provided your flore be laid even, not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7066:21"/> higher before than behind, more then Å¿o much that may make the water to avoyd to his hinder feet, where there ought to be a Å¿mall gutter to cauÅ¿e it to paÅ¿Å¿e away, for in raiÅ¿ing your flore Å¿o much, I doe abÅ¿tract from the ancient ill cuÅ¿tome, by reaÅ¿on that a horÅ¿e Å¿tandeth higher before then he doth behind, his hinder legges will Å¿well, and Å¿o he becommeth lame; beÅ¿ides; it giveth him a taint in the backe and kidneyes; and to conclude, his long Å¿tanding in this uneaÅ¿ie manner, begetteth in the poor beaÅ¿t much pain and griefe, and this occaÅ¿ioneth unto him (which would not otherwiÅ¿e be) the putting forth of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, Pains, Scratches, and Å¿uch like noyÅ¿ome Å¿orances.</p>

Moreover, the Colt beÅ¿ides the milke he draweth from the Mare, will alÅ¿o feed with her upon Hay, Oates, Bran, and Å¿uch like food, which will do him much pleaÅ¿ure: But Å¿ome againe will Å¿ay, that their teeth are Å¿o tender, as that they will not be able to chew and eate Å¿uch kinde of hard meates; I anÅ¿wer, they are very much miÅ¿taken, for, not onely my Å¿elfe alone, but Å¿undry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have with me been eye-witneÅ¿Å¿es of the contrary; therefore this needs no further Å¿olution. And wheras it hath been objected unto me, that that Colt which is foled in May, or <hi>SolÅ¿tice,</hi> in that Å¿eaÅ¿on,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7066:22"/> the Mare will have Å¿tore of milke, thus much I doe ingenuouÅ¿ly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e, but then what manner of milke will it be? None other then Å¿uch as Å¿hall be marvellous thin and watriÅ¿h, (as I Å¿aid before) which abundance will alÅ¿o faile, even when the Colt hath moÅ¿t need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that is, when the Colt beginneth to come up to Å¿ome Å¿trength, and at what time he Å¿hould receive moÅ¿t nutriment, to wit, when the winter commeth on, whoÅ¿e Snows, FroÅ¿ts, cold raines, and Flouds; will not a little nip and pinch the Colt, and enfeeble the Mare in Å¿uch terrible and deÅ¿perate manner, that Å¿he will want her former plenty of food, warme and dry lodging, and other neceÅ¿Å¿ary reliefe and Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tentation, and Å¿o in like manner, her abundance of milke, at what time her poore Colt Å¿hould depend upon the enfeebled Mare, who is not able to Å¿upply its own need: by meanes whereof it muÅ¿t neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arily fall out, that Å¿he muÅ¿t bring both her Å¿elfe and her Colt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame poverty, not being able to Å¿uÅ¿taine her own life, much leÅ¿Å¿e her Colts and her own, and Å¿o become feeble before winter be halfe Å¿pent; and over and above all this, the Colt will by his running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with the Mare, become Å¿o Å¿alvage and wilde, as that if any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity Å¿hould happen to Å¿eize upon it, its own unrulineÅ¿Å¿e will be Å¿o great, that the cure may thereby become the more difficile: for to Å¿peake truely, infinite have been, and daily are the numbers of Colts; yea, and thoÅ¿e many times rightly bred, which have miÅ¿carried and periÅ¿hed in this nature.</p>
               <p>I doe therefore conclude, and as a friend to my Country averre, that the ableÅ¿t way to breed up the beÅ¿t and moÅ¿t Å¿erviceable HorÅ¿es, is (as I have before inculcated) after this methode and none other; and therefore I am bold to adviÅ¿e all noble Gentlemen who are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of good HorÅ¿es, and of this myÅ¿tery, to make triall, and to put theÅ¿e my rudiments in execution, and he will never (I doe well aÅ¿Å¿ure me) hereafter, either alter or Å¿werve from them; for of this kinde of <hi>breeding,</hi> I have had more then forty yeares good experience: during which time, I intimated theÅ¿e my grounds to a Knight, an intimate friend of mine, who was a great lover of good HorÅ¿es, and as great a Breeder, as a lover of them, and very well verÅ¿ed in HorÅ¿e-man-Å¿hip, who hearing my reaÅ¿ons, and throughly digeÅ¿ting them, approved of them Å¿o well, as that he fell to follow theÅ¿e my inÅ¿tructions, and eÅ¿tee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them Å¿ufficient, would never be brought from them after; he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, no way comparable to this: for he found by plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tration, that whereas in former times in breeding (as commonly he did, ten or twelve Colts yearly; when they came to Backing, Riding, and proofe of thoÅ¿e ten or twelve, he thought himÅ¿elfe well appay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his labour and coÅ¿t well beÅ¿towed, if two or three at the moÅ¿t proved right, and to his minde; whereas ever after in ten Colts thus bred and reared up, hardly any one miÅ¿Å¿ed, which proved not right and to his good liking: and this manner of <hi>breeding,</hi> made him more in love with this myÅ¿tery, then ever before, reaÅ¿on dictating it Å¿o well
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7066:22"/> unto him. For, moÅ¿t certain it is, when the Stallion and Mare are both right, and have all their true attributes, and the time, Å¿eaÅ¿on, and manner of <hi>breeding,</hi> with all circumÅ¿tances thereunto belonging, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and in every point duly obÅ¿erved; it will be a hard matter for the Colt to prove ill: but if otherwiÅ¿e, then marvell not if the Colt anÅ¿wer not your expectation, according to the Greeke Adage, which Å¿aith; <gap reason="foreign">

Some there be who hold that Colours, Marks, and Shapes are little materiall to make up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect HorÅ¿e, which I will not contradict, for my meaning is not to traduce or controule any man: but this I will Å¿ay, that if a good horÅ¿e have theÅ¿e properties adherent to his goodneÅ¿Å¿e, then is he queÅ¿tionleÅ¿Å¿e in much better eÅ¿teem, for if beauty be added to his other inward vertues, then is he (like to the Nightingale in the beginning of Aprill, heard and hearkened unto, more praiÅ¿e-worthy, and better prized. For a horÅ¿e, who if he be good and Å¿erviceable, well metled, bold, and hardy, of a gentle condition, of a round and comely trot and pace, lightly and well borne, obedient mouthed, Å¿ure on foot, tough, Å¿trong, and eaÅ¿ie; will (I Å¿ay) not Å¿uch a horÅ¿e be well eÅ¿teemed? But if together with theÅ¿e good properties, there Å¿hall be added, good colour, true marks, and perfect Å¿hape, which cauÅ¿eth him to appeare moÅ¿t beautifull to all beholders: will not theÅ¿e endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Å¿et him the better forth? and cauÅ¿e him to be the better eÅ¿tee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7066:23"/> of every man deÅ¿ired, and much more money offered for him? nay, Å¿hall not you (whoÅ¿e the horÅ¿e is) be come unto, be Å¿ued unto, have letters Å¿ent you from Å¿undry friends, and will not your Å¿elfe prize him at a higher rate than otherwiÅ¿e you would have done? yes aÅ¿Å¿uredly; and hereof I make no queÅ¿tion. True it is, and I muÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e no leÅ¿Å¿e, that a horÅ¿e may be very good, and performe his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction very well, who hath neither good colour, true marks, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Å¿hape; nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e theÅ¿e extrinÅ¿ecall vertues are more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found, and better obÅ¿erved to be in good horÅ¿es, in whom are colour, markes, and Å¿hape; than in horÅ¿es which are otherwiÅ¿e. Wherefore becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e things are termed exteriour vertues, and therefore takes its object from the eye onely, I will conjoyne them altogether in this my diÅ¿courÅ¿e, and Å¿hew you what hath been, and is, the opinion of both ancient and moderne Writers. <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gickes, handling moÅ¿t accurately Å¿undry points of husbandry, among other things in his third book of Georgicks, deÅ¿cribeth the horÅ¿e, as well his breeding, and his Å¿everall Å¿orts of imployments, as his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Å¿hape, and markes; yea, and that in moÅ¿t exquiÅ¿ite manner: And thus he beginneth:

The Browne-Bay is Å¿o highly eÅ¿teemed with all Nations, as that they doe with one aÅ¿Å¿ent alwaies ranke him in the very firÅ¿t place of colours: the Italians and French doe Å¿o much prize the Brown-Bay, as that they evermore call that colour <hi>Bayary Loyall,</hi> the Loyall Bayard, or more properly according to our EngliÅ¿h

This indeede is of all true HorÅ¿e-men eÅ¿teemed a moÅ¿t beautifull good Marke, and well becometh a good HorÅ¿e.

A Knight of my acquaintance would highly commend the HorÅ¿e, who had a white foote, which was beÅ¿peckled with blacke motly Å¿pots; affirming that a HorÅ¿e Å¿o marked did betoken good mettle, great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and a heroick Å¿pirit, for he would alwaies call Å¿uch a HorÅ¿e, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus generoÅ¿us,</hi> a HorÅ¿e of a brave Å¿pirit; and this hee would report, was taught him by old Sir <hi>Henry Lea,</hi> that famous HorÅ¿e-man, and no leÅ¿Å¿e excellent Breeder, of whom this Knight bought many deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Colts, Å¿ome of which were thus marked.

               <p>Now as touching the perfect and true Å¿hape of a HorÅ¿e, wherein we have more contrariety of opinions, than are either in the Colour or Marks, whereof I have given you a taÅ¿t already: NevertheleÅ¿Å¿e, I will demonÅ¿trate how farre commonly all doe meete in the Å¿hape of a well timbred HorÅ¿e.<note place="margin">The perfect Å¿hape of a HorÅ¿e.</note> FirÅ¿t therefore it is required that the hoofe be blacke, Å¿mooth, dry, large, round, and hollow: the PaÅ¿terns Å¿traight, and upright, Fetlocks Å¿hort, the legges Å¿traight, and flat, called alÅ¿o lath-legged, the knees bony, leane and round, the necke long, high-rear'd, and great towards the BreaÅ¿t, the BreaÅ¿t large and round, the Eares Å¿mall, Å¿harpe, long, and upright, the Forehead leane, and large, the Eyes great, full, and black, the Browes well filled and Å¿hooting outwards, the Iawes wide, Å¿lender, and leane, the NoÅ¿thrills wide, and open, the Mouth great, the Head long, and leane like to a Sheepe, the Mane thin and large, the Withers Å¿harp and pointed, the Back Å¿hort, even, plaine, and double chined, the Sides, and Ribbes deepe, large, and bearing out like the cover of a Trunke, and cloÅ¿e Å¿hut at the huckle-bone, the Belly long, and great, but hid under the ribs, the Flanks full, yet gaunt, the Rump round, plaine, and broad, with a large Å¿pace betwixt the Buttocks, the Thighs long, and large, with wel-faÅ¿hioned bones, and thoÅ¿e fleÅ¿hy, the Hams dry, and Å¿treight, the Trunchion Å¿mall, long, well Å¿et on, &amp; well couched, the Trayne long, not too thick, and falling to the ground, the Yard, and Stones Å¿mall; and laÅ¿tly the HorÅ¿e to be well riÅ¿en before. And to conclude, the perfect Å¿hape of a HorÅ¿e, according as a famous HorÅ¿eman hath deÅ¿cribed, is in a few words, thus; <hi>Viz.</hi> A broad Forehead, a great Eye, a leane Head, thin, Å¿lender, leane, wide Iawes; a long, high-rear'd Neck, high-rear'd Withers; a broad, deepe CheÅ¿t, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; upright PaÅ¿terns, and a narrow Hoofe: And this is the common allowed, and approved Å¿hape of a perfect HorÅ¿e; Å¿o as if any of theÅ¿e things be deficient in him, he cannot be Å¿aid to be a HorÅ¿e of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Shape: Wherefore I conclude that if a HorÅ¿e of a good Colour, well Marked, and rightly Shaped, and right alÅ¿o by Syre, and Mare; it will be Å¿eldome Å¿eene that he Å¿hould prove ill, unleÅ¿Å¿e his Nature be alienated, and marred, either in the Backing and Riding, or elÅ¿e that he be otherwiÅ¿e wronged, and moÅ¿t Å¿hamefully abuÅ¿ed by the means of a hare-brain, negligent, or inconÅ¿iderate Rider or Groome. But I may in this point bee taxed to hold a Paradox; for Å¿ome may object unto me, that many times HorÅ¿es, who are of the beÅ¿t Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, beÅ¿t Marks, and trueÅ¿t Shapes, doe nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e prove arrant jades, reÅ¿tiffe, Å¿tubborn, ill natured, Å¿ubject to tyring, and the like: I anÅ¿were, I acknowledge all this to be moÅ¿t true, for I have knowne

Others there be, who have attained to Å¿o much Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Å¿peculative knowledge, by reading the works of MaÅ¿ter <hi>Blunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> MaÅ¿ter <hi>Markham,</hi> and others, getting thereby Å¿ome glimpÅ¿e of Å¿peculation, but leÅ¿Å¿e true practiÅ¿e, (wherein is as much difference as betwixt us and the Antipodes,) and therefore in what eÅ¿teeme they either are or can be among HorÅ¿emen, is moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ie to be imagined. Others there are, who being Å¿o active and dexterous, as to be able to Å¿it a rough unridden Colt, a few plunges, by faÅ¿t holding with both hands to the Mane and Pummell, and by clinging with their legges cloÅ¿e to the body of the horÅ¿e, till by Å¿triving and his violent diÅ¿orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red agitation, he hath put himÅ¿elfe from off his winde; he will not Å¿ticke preÅ¿ently to promiÅ¿e to himÅ¿elfe, the true and entire myÅ¿tery of able HorÅ¿emanÅ¿hip.

Many other rudiments there are to be given, which for that they are Å¿o commonly knowne to every Groome, are impertinent to rehearÅ¿e: Only in a word for a cloÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, that a good Groome ought to be a man of good life, and Å¿ober demeanour, no Tipler, no haunter of Ale-houÅ¿es, or Tavernes, (like as too too many are) no lyer abroad from his HorÅ¿e in the night, nor long from him in the day, and an early riÅ¿er; the Stable muÅ¿t be his Compting-houÅ¿e; he muÅ¿t not be Å¿o intimate with any as with his HorÅ¿e; have entercourÅ¿e with none Å¿o much as with him he muÅ¿t be his principall aÅ¿Å¿ociate, and make him of his Cabbinet-councell: his HorÅ¿e muÅ¿t be his only <hi>Idaea,</hi> the only MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e whom he muÅ¿t court, and Å¿erve: and Å¿o Å¿oone as he doth Å¿uÅ¿pect but any the leaÅ¿t incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in him; let him inÅ¿tantly impart it to the Ferrier, and looke what the Ferrier doth give in directions, let his Keeper diligently obÅ¿erve, and execute accordingly; for it is an argument of a proud and prepoÅ¿terus condition in a Groome, to Å¿warve from the inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> which the Ferrier Å¿hall at any time give. Ninthly, as the Groome muÅ¿t have a Å¿peciall care hee doe not pine, or under-meate his HorÅ¿e, in his dyet; Å¿o he muÅ¿t bee as cautelous hee doe not cloy him, by laying before him too much Provender at once: but his way muÅ¿t be to give him little at once, and often; he muÅ¿t eate up all before he give him any more, yea hee muÅ¿t eate it with good appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, otherwiÅ¿e he may marre his appetite utterly, and bring him to loath his Provender, and looke what Hay and Provender he doth at any time give him, let it be Å¿weet, wel-duÅ¿ted, and throughly purged from Feathers, Hens-dung, Cats-dung, Å¿tones, gravell, and Å¿uch like filth, which are things hurtfull and troubleÅ¿ome to his Å¿tomacke and feeding; for they will cauÅ¿e him to refuÅ¿e and forÅ¿ake his meate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les pure hunger Å¿hall conÅ¿train him thereunto; for Å¿uch kind of naÅ¿ty meate, &amp; food will engender in him noyÅ¿ome &amp; noxious infirmities.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7066:32"/> Tenthly, as touching the furniture and capariÅ¿on which the horÅ¿e <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> is to weare, the Groome muÅ¿t be carefull to keep them clean, bright, and handÅ¿ome: the Saddles, after Å¿weating and travell, well ayred in the Sun and wind, and after beaten and duÅ¿ted, the Å¿tirrops wiped cleane, with the Å¿trops and other Å¿uch like leathers thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and appertaining, and Å¿o put up Å¿afe and handÅ¿omely with their caÅ¿es and coverings upon them to preÅ¿erve them from duÅ¿t: the foot cloaths (if he have any under his charge) cleanÅ¿ed, bruÅ¿hed, and neatly folded up; the Bits taken from the Head-Å¿tals, and cleane wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hed, dryed before the fire; and wrapped up in an oyly cloath to keep them from ruÅ¿t and canker, and the BoÅ¿Å¿es carefully alÅ¿o made clean, together with their Bits, and Å¿o laid up in the PreÅ¿Å¿e or CheÅ¿t made for Å¿uch like purpoÅ¿e. The Head-Å¿tals and Reynes, Croopers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accoutrements would likewiÅ¿e be wiped, made very cleane, and hanged up in the PreÅ¿Å¿e in their proper places: the Girts, SurÅ¿ingles, Stirrip-leathers, and Å¿uch like neceÅ¿Å¿aries, would be diligently viewed and examined, cleanÅ¿ed, and made cleane, and if any thing be amiÅ¿Å¿e or broken, let it be mended incontinently, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould be to doe when they were to be uÅ¿ed: In concluÅ¿ion, nothing Å¿hould be out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> order at any time, but every thing (as well Stable as Saddle-houÅ¿e) kept cleane, neat, and Å¿weet, which will purchaÅ¿e unto the Groome no Å¿mall reÅ¿pect with his Lord or MaÅ¿ter, and much more reputation and applauÅ¿e of Å¿o many as Å¿hall be an eye-witneÅ¿Å¿e thereof.</p>

But if it bee of a pale greeniÅ¿h colour thick, and viÅ¿cous, then certainely his <hi>Backe</hi> is growne weake, and he is in danger of a <hi>ConÅ¿umption</hi> of his <hi>Seede.</hi> But if it be high colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and nebuled or mixed with Å¿mall Cloudes, with a kind of black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e therein, then this doth demonÅ¿trate enÅ¿uing Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e and death, if it be not carefully prevented. But if the NebuloÅ¿ity be diÅ¿perÅ¿ed into Å¿everall parts, and not combined as it were into one <hi>MaÅ¿Å¿e</hi> or <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> this then argueth, that the malice of the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e beginneth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, whereby the <hi>Ferrier</hi> may have great hope of the health of the <hi>HorÅ¿e:</hi> And thus farre I have by diligent obÅ¿ervation found to bee moÅ¿t certaine, Whereby I have brought many a deÅ¿perate Malady to it's wiÅ¿hed Cure, which otherwiÅ¿e I could not Å¿o eaÅ¿ily have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>

But both my MaÅ¿ter and my Å¿elfe doe commonly adminiÅ¿ter two Spoonefulls at the moÅ¿t at a time, in a pint of white Wine, or with a quart of good Ale or Beere, which we hold to be much better and Å¿afer, and we have found it evermore to worke to our hearts deÅ¿ire: inÅ¿omuch as wee have both wrought admirable Cures therewith, I doe aÅ¿Å¿ure you.</p>

                     <p>Yes Sir, there is Å¿uch a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, but it Å¿o Å¿eldome comes to a HorÅ¿e, as that few Ferriers have had occaÅ¿ion to cure the Å¿ame; by reaÅ¿on very few know it, and therefore marvell not in that they cannot cure the Å¿ame. Saint <hi>Anthonies Fire</hi> is that burneth in the fleÅ¿h moÅ¿t extreamely, and hath in it Å¿o great malice, as that look what you do apply to the place (unleÅ¿Å¿e you hit the cure right) it will doe it no good, but more harme, much after the nature of a <hi>Noli me tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> or <hi>wild-fire.</hi> This diÅ¿eaÅ¿e is alÅ¿o called by Å¿ome the <hi>Å¿hingles</hi> in a HorÅ¿e, and like as the DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e it Å¿elf is very rare, and Å¿eldome known in a HorÅ¿e, Å¿o alÅ¿o is the cure as uncouth and Å¿trange. For my part I will not profeÅ¿Å¿e my Å¿elfe to be any whit more skilfull then indeed I am: this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e I never yet obÅ¿erved to be in any HorÅ¿e: I only have heard Å¿ome Ferriers talke thereof, but yet I never heard but of one man, who was ever truely able to make a Cure thereof; and this was a Knight of very good worÅ¿hip who taught it me, he averring confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently unto me; how that he had cured three Å¿everall HorÅ¿es of this very malady. I asked him whence this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e proceedeth, and what are the Å¿ymptomes whereby to know the Å¿ame; he anÅ¿wered me, that he could never rightly come to be mathematically aÅ¿Å¿ured how it breedeth, or occurreth to the HorÅ¿e, but by gueÅ¿Å¿e onely, and that himÅ¿elfe thought it came from Å¿ome <hi>cholericke bloud</hi> paÅ¿Å¿ing to his <hi>head</hi> into the <hi>braine</hi> and <hi>pannicles,</hi> which cauÅ¿eth the HorÅ¿e to become Å¿tarke mad, yea Å¿o truely mad, as to be deprived of his memory, in not knowing his <hi>Keeper,</hi> or any other body elÅ¿e; yea his fury is Å¿o great, as to reÅ¿iÅ¿t Å¿tripes, to Å¿light and contemne correction be it never Å¿o Å¿evere, he will endeavour what in him lyeth to perpetrate what miÅ¿chiefe he is able, by biting, Å¿triking, and endangering whom or whatÅ¿oever thing commeth into his way, and when he cannot have his minde of living <hi>creatures</hi> whereupon to wreake his malice, then will he doe it partly upon dead creatures, by biting and gnawing the Manger and Racke-Å¿taves, and by Å¿triking the poÅ¿ts and barres with his <hi>heeles,</hi> and partly upon himÅ¿elfe by beating his <hi>head</hi> againÅ¿t the wall and ground;<note place="margin">S. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> fire.</note> he will alÅ¿o forÅ¿ake both his meat and Å¿leep, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reÅ¿t, untill he dyeth, if he be not in time cured, which is thus.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I Å¿ay it is a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e whereunto Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es are oft times enclined, and it commeth Å¿undry wayes, to wit, Å¿ometimes with too much feeding without exerciÅ¿e, Å¿ometimes of too hard and immoderate riding or other labour; both which waies the <hi>bloud</hi> of the creature becommeth corrupted and inflamed, which maketh its reÅ¿idence in and about the heart, which if it Å¿hould not have a way to make its vent, it would quickly kill him, by which meanes many good HorÅ¿es dye Å¿uddenly, and the cauÅ¿e unknowne. This DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e is apparent to the <hi>eye</hi> by a Å¿welling which will ariÅ¿e in the middle of the <hi>breaÅ¿t</hi> juÅ¿t againÅ¿t the <hi>heart</hi> from whence it taketh its name, which if it be not Å¿oone prevented, will aÅ¿cend to the <hi>throat,</hi> and then it is certaine death. It commeth likewiÅ¿e by Å¿urfets taken by heats and colds, Å¿ometimes alÅ¿o by Feavers, which are malignant, and Å¿ometimes againe by feeding upon unwholeÅ¿ome meats. The Å¿ignes to know this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e before the Å¿welling doe appeare are theÅ¿e: he will be Å¿icke and grone many times when he is layed, he will hang down his head, and forÅ¿ake his meat; and then if he Å¿hould deÅ¿ire to eate, what meat he loveth beÅ¿t, whether Hay, GraÅ¿Å¿e, Provender, or Bread, lay it upon the ground before him, and if he hath a minde to eate thereof, albeit he make proffer to bring his <hi>mouth</hi> towards it, yet he Å¿hall not be able to reach it, but will Å¿ooner famiÅ¿h: when you doe perceive the Å¿welling to appeare, firÅ¿t draw bloud from both the <hi>Plate-veynes,</hi> but if you cannot finde them, then let him <hi>bloud</hi> on both Å¿ides of the <hi>necke</hi> to a good proportion; which done, you may give him the drinke of <hi>Diapente</hi> with Beere or Ale, putting thereinto one ounce of browne Å¿ugar candy, and halfe an ounce of <hi>London Treacle,</hi> which will drive the Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e and griefe from his <hi>heart;</hi> which done, annoynt the Å¿welling with this Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Take Hogges greaÅ¿e, Bores greace, and BaÅ¿ilicon,<note place="margin">Anticor.</note> of each three ounces, incorporate all theÅ¿e well into one body, and annoynt and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7066:56"/> rub the Å¿welling therewith every day till it come to a Å¿oftneÅ¿Å¿e, and then open it, and let forth all the corrupted matter: then waÅ¿h the Sore with your Coperas water mentioned in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. Â§ 4. and then put in your green Oyntment preÅ¿cribed you in <hi>capite ibidem,</hi> and it will be Å¿oon whole. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> Thus have I cured many HorÅ¿es of this DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaÅ¿e, and I never failed if the HorÅ¿e had not been Å¿welled too high towards the <hi>throat</hi> or <hi>necke,</hi> before I took him in hand. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> But Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter <hi>Blundeviles</hi> and MaÅ¿ter <hi>Markhams</hi> cure for an <hi>Anticor,</hi> is thus.</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t they let him <hi>bloud</hi> in the <hi>plate-veins,</hi> and then they give him this drinke. Take a quart of MalmeÅ¿ey, and put thereto halfe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of Sugar, and of Cinamon two ounces, and Å¿o give it him bloud-warme, and keep him warme in the Stable, eÅ¿pecially his <hi>breaÅ¿t,</hi> that no winde doe offend him; and for his drinke, let it be warm Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hes, and Å¿uch meat as he will eate. And if the Å¿welling doe appeare, then beÅ¿ides letting him <hi>bloud,</hi> they doe Å¿trike the Å¿welling in divers places with their flegme, that the corruption may goe forth, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the place with warme Hogges greaÅ¿e, and that will cauÅ¿e it to weare away, or elÅ¿e grow to a head if it be kept warme. Thus MaÅ¿ter <hi>Blundevile,</hi> and MaÅ¿ter <hi>Markhams</hi> cure is in effect the very Å¿ame. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter <hi>Markham</hi> alÅ¿o preÅ¿cribeth MalmeÅ¿ey and <hi>Diapente,</hi> which is uÅ¿ed alÅ¿o by others, and it is very good: and he alÅ¿o Å¿aith that Å¿ome do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿ter <hi>Doctor Stephens water,</hi> whith he affirmeth he hath Å¿een to have wrought in this kinde Å¿trange effects. For my part I Å¿ubmit, for that theÅ¿e <hi>Receits</hi> Å¿eeme very probable; howÅ¿oever I never did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment any but that onely which I firÅ¿t inÅ¿erted, which I had of a famous Ferrier in <hi>France,</hi> and therefore I finding mine to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, made tryall of none other.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>French MarÅ¿hall</hi> taught me a Medicine for an <hi>Attaint</hi> or <hi>Over-reach,</hi> whereof I did never make uÅ¿e; howbeit he proteÅ¿ted unto me he thought it one of the beÅ¿t cures that he could ever know, and I my Å¿elfe Å¿aw him dreÅ¿Å¿e a <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> therewith, but how the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> became
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7066:57"/> cured I had not time to know, by reaÅ¿on I departed from <hi>Orleans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cure was performed. And the Cure was this. Take one or two handfuls of Saxafrage, and all the Sewet of a Loine of Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and a pint of white Wine; chop the Hearb, and mince the Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et very Å¿mall; and Å¿o boyle all theÅ¿e together, which being thus well boyled, take a Å¿ufficient quantity of <hi>HorÅ¿e-dung</hi> newly made by a <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> that goeth to graÅ¿Å¿e, and putting it to the other Ingredients, worke it to a Salve, and apply it plaiÅ¿ter-wiÅ¿e to the place good hot, renewing it twice every day for Å¿o long time as you Å¿hall think to be convenient.</p>
                     <p>Now MaÅ¿ter <hi>Blundevile,</hi> and MaÅ¿ter <hi>Markham</hi> doe both agree in the Cure of an <hi>Attaint</hi> which is thus: FirÅ¿t, waÅ¿h and bath the place with warme Water, and Å¿have the haire Å¿o farre as the Å¿welling go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; then Å¿carrifie the Å¿ore place with the point of a Razor, that the bloud may iÅ¿Å¿ue forth: Then take Cantharides and Euforbium, of each halfe an ounce, powdered, and mingle them together with a quarterne of Sope, and with a Å¿hy Å¿pread Å¿ome of the Oyntment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Å¿ore, Å¿uffering him to reÅ¿t in the place where you dreÅ¿Å¿ed him for one halfe houre after, and then you may take him into the Stable, there letting him Å¿tand without Litter, and Å¿o tyed that hee may not touch the Å¿ore with his <hi>Mouth,</hi> and then the next day uÅ¿e him in the Å¿ame manner againe; then the third day annoint the place with freÅ¿h Butter; continuing Å¿o to doe by the Å¿pace of nine dayes, and at nine daies end, make him this bath.</p>
                     <p>Take Mallowes three handfulls, a RoÅ¿e-Cake, and Sage of each a handfull: boyle them together in a Å¿ufficient quantity of faire wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and when the Mallowes are become Å¿oft, put in halfe a pound of Butter, and halfe a pint of Sallet Oyle, and then being Å¿omewhat warme; waÅ¿h and bath the Å¿ore place therewith every day once, till it be whole. This Medicine I confeÅ¿Å¿e I never tryed, but I think it very good. MaÅ¿ter <hi>Blundevile</hi> hath only this, but MaÅ¿ter <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> hath Å¿undry others: Å¿ome of which, I will relate, to the end the <hi>Ferrier</hi> may make his choyce. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take Dialthea, Agrippa, and Oyle, and mixing theÅ¿e together lay it to the Å¿welling. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take alÅ¿o FrankinÅ¿ence, RoÅ¿in, Tarre, Euforbium, Turpentine, Fennugrick, of each a quarter of an ounce, of Sewet one ounce, of Oyle one ounce, of Wax three ounces, &amp; three quarters of an ounce of Myrrh; mix and melt all theÅ¿e together, and plaiÅ¿ter-wiÅ¿e lay it to the place till it be whole. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take alÅ¿o Sanguis-Draconis three quarters of an ounce, Bole-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monack one ounce, Oyle as much, MaÅ¿tick three ounces, Suet, as much, and as much Swines greaÅ¿e: melt and mix all theÅ¿e together and lay it to the Å¿welling, and it will take it away.</p>
                     <p>Another Cure I found in an old ManuÅ¿cript, with which I have cured many <hi>horÅ¿es,</hi> which have been much Å¿welled, which is this: <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <hi>Wind</hi> they will kill him out right, if it be not in time cured; and I my Å¿elfe have Å¿eene and knowne <hi>HorÅ¿es</hi> dy of this malady. It proceedeth moÅ¿t commonly of RankneÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Bloud:</hi> in the cure, care muÅ¿t be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that you doe not touch the Graynes or Kernells with your fin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers The <hi>Avives</hi> or <hi>Vives</hi> are certaine flat Kernells, much like Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Grapes which grow in a cluÅ¿ter, cloÅ¿e knotted together in the place; the moÅ¿t certaine cure is to cut the <hi>Skin</hi> longeÅ¿t-wayes, and to lay the Kernells or Graines open, and then with an InÅ¿trument made like to a paire of Pliers to pinch forth the Graynes, then to apply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place eyther a linnen-cloth, or a few hurds Å¿teeped well in whites of Egges well beaten, and Å¿o bound on, and renewing it day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will cure it: but you muÅ¿t heale up the <hi>Skin</hi> with the Greene-Oyntment before Å¿poken of <hi>in Cap. &amp;</hi> Â§. <hi>Ib.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. But the common cure is to draw downe the Å¿ore with a hot Iron juÅ¿t in the midÅ¿t, Å¿o farre as the Å¿welling goeth, and then under the roote of the <hi>Eare,</hi> draw two other Å¿trokes of the faÅ¿hion of an arrowes head, then open the <hi>skin,</hi> and with a Å¿mall payre of plyers, pull out the kernels, and Å¿o cut them off, but have a care of the <hi>veine:</hi> that done, fill the place with Bay-Å¿alt made into fine powder, and after heale up the Å¿ore with the aforeÅ¿aid Oyntment. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>.

                     <p>MaÅ¿ter <hi>Blundevile</hi> and MaÅ¿ter <hi>Markham</hi> doe Å¿ay, that the <hi>Italians</hi> uÅ¿e to take a Å¿punge well dipped in Å¿trong wine vineger, and bound to the Sore, renewing it twice a day till the kernels doe rot; then they open the neather moÅ¿t part of the Å¿oftneÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿o let the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption forth, and then fill the hole with Å¿alt finely brayed: and the next day they waÅ¿h away the filth with warme water, and the next day after, they annoynt the Sore with Honey and Fich flower min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together till it be whole. This Cure I never made tryall of, but it Å¿eemeth to me to be a very good and probable Cure. Another for the Avives.</p>
                     <p>Take Tarre, tryed Hogges greaÅ¿e, Bay-Å¿alt, and FrankinÅ¿ence powdred, of each Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, melt theÅ¿e on the fire all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then with a clout faÅ¿tened to the end of a Å¿ticke, boyling hot Å¿cald the places 4 or 5 mornings one after another, untill the enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med places doe become Å¿oft and ripe. Then with your inciÅ¿ion knife Å¿lit the skin, and let forth the corruption: then to heale up the Å¿oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, take tryed Hogges greaÅ¿e and VerdigreaÅ¿e made into fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, melt them upon a gentle fire, but Å¿uffer it not to boyle more then a waume or two at the moÅ¿t, then take it off, and put to it of ordinary Turpentine, as much as will Å¿uffice, and Å¿o Å¿tirre all together untill it be cold. And herewith annoint the Å¿orances daily, till they be whole: <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good.</p>

                     <p>Take the tendertops of Rue, Boxe-leaves, and PrimroÅ¿e-roots,<note place="margin">Biting of mad Dog.</note> of each a handfull, pound them together in a morter, and put them into a quart of new milke, with <hi>London</hi> Treacle one ounce, and Å¿o give it him bloud warme.

                     <p>Take Hobgoblin, perewincle, and Boxe leaves, of each one handfull, firÅ¿t mince them Å¿mall, and then Å¿tampe them very Å¿mall in a Å¿tone morter, and with milke or beere adminiÅ¿ter it, both at the Change or Full of the Moone. A third cure I alÅ¿o have, which is this:</p>
                     <p>Take the hearb which groweth in dry and barren hils, called <hi>The Starre of the earth;</hi> you muÅ¿t give it three dayes together; the firÅ¿t time you muÅ¿t gather three of theÅ¿e hearbs with all the whole roots, and waÅ¿h them cleane, and wipe them cleane, then pound them well, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing no part of them; which done, give it your HorÅ¿e in Milke, Beer, Ale, or white Wine; but be carefull the HorÅ¿e take all the hearbs and roots: but if you will, you may make up theÅ¿e hearbs and roots in freÅ¿h or Å¿weet butter which will doe as well: the Å¿econd day give your HorÅ¿e five of theÅ¿e hearbs and roots, like as you gave him them the day before; and the third day give him Å¿eaven. Doe this punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as I have here preÅ¿cribed you, and be you well aÅ¿Å¿ured your HorÅ¿e will be perfectly cured: for albeit I my Å¿elfe have never tryed this medicine, yet I doe know the party of whom I had this Cure, hath cured much cattell of all Å¿orts therewith, for it cureth all Å¿orts of living creatures which Å¿hall be bitten by a <hi>mad Dog;</hi> I my Å¿elfe can Å¿ay thus much of this Receit, that I knew it cure a whole <hi>kennell</hi> of <hi>Hounds</hi> of a Gentlemans, one Beagle excepted which they did not

To Å¿peake therefore firÅ¿t of the <hi>Bloud Spaven,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bloud-Spaven.</note> it is a DiÅ¿eaÅ¿e which groweth upon the <hi>hough,</hi> with a Å¿welling which is full of <hi>bloud,</hi> which though it be greateÅ¿t upon the inÅ¿ide, yet the Å¿welling appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alÅ¿o upon the outÅ¿ide, being fed and nouriÅ¿hed by the great <hi>veine</hi> which runneth along the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>thigh,</hi> and Å¿o commeth along the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>hough,</hi> and Å¿o downe the <hi>legge</hi> to the <hi>paÅ¿terne,</hi> and Å¿o from the <hi>paÅ¿tern</hi> to the bottome of the <hi>foot.</hi> This malady com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by meanes that the bloud is corrupted through hard riding, eÅ¿pecially when the HorÅ¿e is very young.

                     <p>I Say Sir, that <hi>Bloud-Å¿hotten Eyes</hi> may eaÅ¿ily be holpen, if a right Cure be taken, and the <hi>Ferrier</hi> perite: for as touching <hi>Eyes,</hi> they are a tender <hi>Member,</hi> Å¿ooneÅ¿t hurt and offended of any part about the <hi>body</hi> of any living <hi>Creature;</hi> and therefore there ought the greater care to be taken in the Cure thereof: and take this by the way for a point of good CounÅ¿ell, and for a good Rule, that in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tring to the <hi>Eyes,</hi> you be very carefull that your Medicine bee not too old, but often made and renewed; for by uÅ¿ing old made Medicines, either their Vertues do paÅ¿Å¿e away, whereby the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> dreÅ¿Å¿ed receives no good; or elÅ¿e, by being too old, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines may moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ily putrifie and corrupt, and Å¿o by that meanes do much more harme than good to the <hi>Member</hi> you hoped to cure; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿omuch as if you be not very cautelous in making and compounding your <hi>Receipts</hi> for the <hi>Eyes</hi> aright, you may moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ily endeavouring to cure one <hi>Eye,</hi> not faile in putting out both. All diÅ¿eaÅ¿es in the <hi>Eyes</hi> come only of two CauÅ¿es: <hi>viz.</hi> FirÅ¿t, either inward, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; Secondly, by meanes of Å¿ome Blow, Stripe, Prick, Cut, BruiÅ¿e, or Å¿ome Å¿uch like accident. The Inward CauÅ¿es do either proceed from evill <hi>Humours,</hi> which do make their reÅ¿ort to the <hi>Eyes,</hi>

                     <p>For this malady I uÅ¿e evermore to take varniÅ¿h, and to put it into faire water, and to beat the water and varniÅ¿h very well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then I powre away the water from the varniÅ¿h, and Å¿o with a feather I annoynt the place burned,<note place="margin">Burning with Å¿hot.</note> and in few times dreÅ¿Å¿ing, it will kill the fire; which done, I heale the Å¿orance with carnifying and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Å¿alves. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good.</p>
                     <p>But I will now give you two or three other unguents, which are moÅ¿t precious againÅ¿t all Å¿orts of burnings, which is this.</p>
                     <p>Take Hogges greaÅ¿e as much as will Å¿uffice, Å¿et it upon the fire, and let it boyle well, and as the skimme ariÅ¿eth, take it away with a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Å¿uch like thing, untill no more will ariÅ¿e; that done, and that it hath boyled enough, then put it forth into an earthen veÅ¿Å¿ell, and Å¿et it forth into the open ayre foure or five nights, after which time you muÅ¿t waÅ¿h it in a great quantity of cleere running or fountaine water, to the end it may be free from Å¿alt or other filth, and waÅ¿h it Å¿o long in Å¿undry waters in Å¿ome great bowle, until it come to be very white, Then melt onely this oyntment, and Å¿o keep it for your uÅ¿e, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with annoynt the places grieved, and in Å¿hort time it will cure them. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This I had of a famous French MariÅ¿hall, and I have often uÅ¿ed it, and I ever found it to be moÅ¿t Å¿overaigne for all Å¿orts of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. But if Hogges greaÅ¿e may not be had, then take the fat of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and waÅ¿h it well, and it is marvellous good. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> Another,</p>
                     <p>Take freÅ¿h butter, and the whites of egges, of each as much as will Å¿uffice, beat them well together, till you bring them to a formall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, and annoint the places burned therewith, and it will Å¿peedily take away the fire and cure them Å¿oundly. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is alÅ¿o Å¿peciall good. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take a Å¿tone of quick-lime which muÅ¿t be well burned, (that which is beÅ¿t burned, will be lighteÅ¿t) diÅ¿Å¿olve it in faire water, and when the water is Å¿ettled, Å¿o as all the Lime remaineth in the bottome, Å¿traine the cleereÅ¿t of the water thorow a fine cleane linnen cloath, then put unto this water either the oyle of Hemp-Å¿eed, or of the oyle of Olive, of like quantity with the water, and Å¿o beating them well together, you Å¿hall have an excellent unguent moÅ¿t precious for all Å¿orts of burnings. And the nature of theÅ¿e three unguents be to leave no Å¿carres. Wherefore we apply them for moÅ¿t Å¿overaign remedies as well for man as beaÅ¿t in caÅ¿es of this nature. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This alÅ¿o I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tryed, and I have found them all to be moÅ¿t Å¿ingular.</p>

                        </note> They are Å¿o ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant to the <hi>eye,</hi> that any man may point at them with his finger. The way to free your HorÅ¿e of them, is firÅ¿t: take up Å¿uch veines as you may know to feed them; then Å¿have away the hayre from about the places, and for foure dayes together, lay <hi>Aegiptiacum</hi> to them; at foure dayes end, waÅ¿h and bathe the places with Å¿trong wine vineger made hot; then take wine vineger one pinte, green coperas and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers gals, of each foure ounces, cantharides two ounces, bay Å¿alt one handfull, make theÅ¿e into fine powder, and let them boyle on the fire with the vineger a little, and Å¿o waÅ¿h the Å¿orances therewith Å¿calding hot, and every third day continue thus to doe till you perceive them to dry up. Let the Å¿curfe fall away of its own accord at leiÅ¿ure, if any more Å¿hall happen to grow forth afterwards, apply the Å¿ame medicine againe, albeit it was formerly cured by the Å¿ame thing: yet I have not Å¿een any HorÅ¿e to fall into the Å¿ame malady againe, and during the time you have him in cure, let him not come in any water, but keep him in the Å¿table warme. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> Another cure is this: FirÅ¿t (as before) Å¿have away the <hi>hayre,</hi> and take up the <hi>veins</hi> which feed thoÅ¿e Å¿oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then Å¿ixe dayes after, let him <hi>bloud</hi> in the <hi>heeles</hi> to draw away the <hi>humours</hi> downwards: then waÅ¿h and bathe him well with hot vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; which done, take a quart of oyle of Nuts, and Verdegreace powdred two ounces, and a quarter of a pinte of Inke; mixe all theÅ¿e well together, and apply it cold to the places, rubbing and bathing them well therewith, and if the knots and warts doe not begin to dry up at the firÅ¿t dreÅ¿Å¿ing, then muÅ¿t you begin again every fourth day untill Å¿uch time as they be throughly cured. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> Another, Take courÅ¿e honey one pound, Verdegreace in powder three ounces, mixe theÅ¿e well together with the fineÅ¿t wheat flowre, and Å¿o bring it to an oyntment, and after you have cleanÅ¿ed the Å¿orances as before is Å¿hewed you, apply this oyntment to the place with a rowler: if there be any warts among the knots, cut them away cleane before you doe apply the Å¿aid oyntment, and thus doing ten or twelve dayes every other day, he will be perfectly cured. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> Another: Shave away the <hi>hayre,</hi> and take up the <hi>veins</hi> as aforeÅ¿aid, then waÅ¿h and bath the place well, then take mutton Å¿ewet, mallowes, and brimÅ¿tone, make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction hereof, &amp; when you have very well bathed the Å¿orances with the Å¿aid decoction, take the Å¿ubÅ¿tance thereof, and putting it between two linnen cloaths, make it faÅ¿t to the place over night, and in the morning take it away, which done, apply unto the place this unguent, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:7066:70"/>
                     <p>Take vineger and mutton Å¿uet, the gumme of the Pine-tree, new waxe, and roÅ¿in of each like much: melt all theÅ¿e together (but put in your Gum laÅ¿t) and Å¿o annoint the Å¿orances with a feather twice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day till they be whole. Of this Cure I never made tryall, but it Å¿eemeth to be a good one. You muÅ¿t not forget in every of theÅ¿e Cures to take up Å¿uch <hi>veines</hi> which in your judgement you may finde to feed thoÅ¿e Å¿orances, and to Å¿have away the <hi>hayre</hi> from about them cleane. Now with this other Cure, I will conclude. WaÅ¿h and bathe the places with the decoction laÅ¿t before mentioned, and lay the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance to the Å¿ores. Take then new Waxe, Turpentine, and Gum A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabicke, of each like much: melt them to an unguent, and herewith annoint the Å¿orances; during which time, let him come into no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Poults of Mallowes, &amp;c. muÅ¿t be every night applyed till he be whole. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take (and to conclude) blew Å¿late and brimÅ¿tone, of each four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, VerdigreaÅ¿e one ounce, made into fine powder, then take freÅ¿h butter four pound, melt it in a Å¿mall kettle or PoÅ¿net, and Å¿o Å¿oon as the butter is molten, put into it all the former ingredients, and Å¿o let them boyle wel; and when you have brought it to a perfect unguent, take it off, and keep it for your uÅ¿e. And when you would uÅ¿e it, warm thereof upon a chafing diÅ¿h and coles, and annoynt your HorÅ¿e ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon the Å¿orance, and that but once, and it will Å¿uffice. But you muÅ¿t let him <hi>bloud</hi> the day before you doe annoint him in the <hi>necke veine.</hi> And at the end of eight dayes, take a quantity of cold Lee, and three ounces of blacke Å¿ope, and waÅ¿h the Å¿orance therewith. This quantity of oyntment will Å¿erve but onely for two HorÅ¿es. Of this Receit I never had occaÅ¿ion to make tryall; but it was taught me by a famous <hi>MariÅ¿hall</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who commended it unto me for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary good Receit; and truely it Å¿eemes to me Å¿o to be.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Take the leafe of the hearb called SaubÅ¿ucus,<note place="margin">CaÅ¿t in a Halter.</note> Å¿tamp it and Å¿trayn it, and take only the juyce thereof, and apply the Å¿aid juyce to the Å¿orance by waÅ¿hing it therewith, after take a linnen cloth, white and cleane, and make it into three or foure folds, Å¿teeping the cloath in the Å¿aid juyce, and bind it on to the place grieved: but in Winter when the Å¿aid Leafe is not to be had, you muÅ¿t take the Å¿econd rinde thereof, and do therewith as before; but then note, that before you waÅ¿h and apply the Å¿aide juyce to the wound, you muÅ¿t firÅ¿t waÅ¿h the Å¿orance with warme Water, and then apply your Å¿aid juyce, and he Å¿halbe perfectly cured in Å¿hort time. This I never yet experienced, by reaÅ¿on I could never yet meete with the Hearb. This Å¿econd I have often tryed, and I have found it to bee infallible, <hi>viz.</hi> Make a Rowle of fat Wooll, and Å¿teepe the Å¿ame in Vineger and Sheepes Suet Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, boyled together till it commeth to bee very thick, and let the Rowle bee full as long, or rather Å¿omewhat longer then the place gauled: apply this to the Å¿orance PlaiÅ¿ter-wiÅ¿e, and bind upon it a cleane Linnen cloth, changing it twiÅ¿e a day, and in Å¿hort time it wilbe whole.

                        <hi>Cauterization</hi> or giving of fire is of two natures, <hi>viz. Actuall</hi> and <hi>Potentiall:</hi> your <hi>Cautery actuall</hi> is made by hot bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inÅ¿truments, with which you Å¿eare and burn thoÅ¿e places which be requiÅ¿ite for the perfecting of the Cure you have in hand, which cannot be peradventure otherwiÅ¿e well cured, but by giving of the fire: as in caÅ¿e of great impoÅ¿tumations, Å¿tanching of <hi>bloud</hi> in wounds, or in Å¿earing of <hi>veines, Å¿inewes,</hi> or the like: or elÅ¿e in caÅ¿e of diÅ¿mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, if other meanes be not at hand, whereby to Å¿tay the flux of <hi>bloud</hi> without danger of bleeding to death, and Å¿o likewiÅ¿e in very many caÅ¿es of this nature, wherein I doe adviÅ¿e all men that are not very perfect in giving the fire, that they doe not practiÅ¿e upon Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of price,<note place="margin">Cautery actuall.</note> but firÅ¿t upon Iades, and low-prized HorÅ¿es, to the end they may the better come to know how to carry their hand, and to underÅ¿tand themÅ¿elves in this Art the better: as when they are to uÅ¿e the lighter, and when the heavier hand; as alÅ¿o that they do make their circles round, and their lines Å¿treight and even, and not crooked
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7066:72"/> or waving. For this <hi>actuall fire</hi> is a thing moÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿ary for them that doe truely know and underÅ¿tand the true uÅ¿e and vertue thereof, and therefore it ought to be very carefully, judiciouÅ¿ly, and moderately applyed, and never but upon good and very conÅ¿iderate grounds: which in Å¿o doing, you Å¿hall finde it to be a moÅ¿t Å¿overaigne remedy to hinder and Å¿tay all manner of corruption whereunto any member may be enclined, provided that in the handling of your inÅ¿trument, you touch not <hi>MuÅ¿cles, Arteries, Sinewes, Ligaments, Cords,</hi> or the like, for Å¿o you may utterly lame where you would Å¿et upright, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy where you would cure, excepting onely in caÅ¿es needfull. For by applying this <hi>actuall fire,</hi> you Å¿hall joyne and conglutinate parts and <hi>members</hi> Å¿evered, dry up Å¿uperfluous moyÅ¿ture, and Å¿inke <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> Å¿welled: you Å¿hall beÅ¿ides bring forth all evill and putrifactious matter congealed and gathered into knots, as Wens, Biles, PuÅ¿tils, Exulcerations, and the like: you Å¿hall alÅ¿o aÅ¿Å¿wage old griefes, and make perfect all Å¿uch parts of the <hi>body</hi> as be any way corrupted: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿hall you need feare the increaÅ¿e of any evill <hi>humours,</hi> by reaÅ¿on that the <hi>skin</hi> being Å¿evered by meanes of the hot iron, it doth ripen and digeÅ¿t all manner of putrifaction and matrative Å¿tuffe, whereby it venteth and paÅ¿Å¿eth away much more eaÅ¿ily, healing and qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all griefe and paine, cauÅ¿ing the <hi>member</hi> which before was Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to feÅ¿tring and to gangrene, to become the Å¿ounder, and by much the Å¿tronger, Å¿o as nothing of diÅ¿advantage will be remaining, but the <hi>Å¿car</hi> onely, where the iron paÅ¿Å¿ed, and the worÅ¿t that can be made thereof, will be but a little <hi>eye-Å¿ore.</hi> But then you muÅ¿t have a very great regard unto your InÅ¿truments that they be made according to the nature and quality of the place and <hi>member</hi> which is to be Å¿eared: for one faÅ¿hion will not Å¿erve in all cauÅ¿es; for as the places which are to be <hi>cauterized</hi> are commonly different in Å¿hape and proportion, Å¿o alÅ¿o ought the Å¿hapes and faÅ¿hions of your inÅ¿truments to be made accordingly. You are alÅ¿o to have a Å¿peciall care to the heating of your inÅ¿truments, which ought to be done with a right good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for as they muÅ¿t not be too cold, Å¿o ought they not to be too hot, for by that meanes you may eaÅ¿ily enflame the <hi>cauterized</hi> places too much: Againe, in giving the fire great care muÅ¿t be had to the bearing of the hand, for therein conÅ¿iÅ¿teth very great cunning, and as I have before admoniÅ¿hed you to be carefull that you touch not any <hi>Å¿inew</hi> or <hi>ligament,</hi> Å¿o no fire is to be given to the diÅ¿location or fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any bone. And as touching the <hi>mettle</hi> whereof your inÅ¿truments are to be made: Å¿ome commend and prefer <hi>gold, Å¿ilver,</hi> and <hi>braÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> or <hi>copper</hi> before <hi>Å¿teele</hi> or <hi>iron:</hi> but I will not controule any mans know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge confeÅ¿Å¿ing mine own to be the leaÅ¿t; Onely thus much I may averre of that little I have (through Gods permiÅ¿Å¿ion) that having made tryall of them all, yet I have ever in all my practiÅ¿e found <hi>iron</hi> and <hi>Å¿teele</hi> to be the very beÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t certaine to worke with, of all the other <hi>mettals,</hi> and my reaÅ¿on is, becauÅ¿e <hi>Å¿teele</hi> or <hi>iron</hi> will retaine

                     <p>Take of white wine one pinte, of Burr-Å¿eeds eight ounces,<note place="margin">Collicke and Stone.</note> made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fine powder, of ParÅ¿ley-Å¿eed two ounces, in powder alÅ¿o, of IÅ¿ope, unÅ¿et Leekes, and Water-CreÅ¿Å¿es, of each halfe a handfull, of black Sope halfe an ounce; Å¿tamp all the hearbs in a morter, and Å¿traine them with the Wine, then put to that liquor, your Burre and ParÅ¿ley Å¿eeds, and Å¿o give it him bloud-warme; this will breake the Å¿tone, and bring it from him with much eaÅ¿e, and cure his <hi>Collicke.</hi>

                     <p>Take of the Å¿irop of Colts-foote, one ounce, of Elecampane rootes dryed, AnniÅ¿eeds, and Licoris, of each halfe an ounce, all made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fine powder, browne Sugar Candy powdred one ounce, which muÅ¿t be divided into two parts, then take Å¿weete Butter Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, and Å¿o make this into three Pills good and Å¿tiffe; which done, rowle them in the other moyty of your powdred Sugar Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Å¿o give them your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> faÅ¿ting, then ride him gently for halfe an houre, and after Å¿et him up warme, and let him faÅ¿t three houres after, cauÅ¿ing him to be well rubbed: let him drinke no cold

                     <p>Take the cankerous MoÅ¿Å¿e of an old Pale, or of the lymbes of an old Oake two handfulls, chop and Å¿hred it Å¿mall, and boyle it in a pottle of new Milke, and with it a roote of Alecompane, let theÅ¿e boile together till halfe be conÅ¿umed, then Å¿traine it, and preÅ¿Å¿e the MoÅ¿Å¿e and Roote very well; which done, put to it of Å¿weete But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the quantity of a Ducke-Egge, and Å¿o give it him in a morning faÅ¿ting bloud warme, and ride him moderately an houre after: then Å¿et him up, cloath him and litter him warme, and order him as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿tomed with <hi>HorÅ¿es</hi> in <hi>PhyÅ¿icke:</hi> Let him have this drink three mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings together, and it will cure both his Cold and Cough wet or dry, or his Poze if he have it.

                     <p>Take of <hi>Auripigmentum</hi> and of Colts-foote made into powder, of each two drammes, then with Venice Turpentine worke them into a Å¿tiffe paÅ¿te, and make them into Å¿mall Cakes the breadth of a Å¿ix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and dry them a little, and then put fire into a Chafing-diÅ¿h with coales, and Å¿o put one of theÅ¿e Cakes upon the coales, covered with a Tunnell, and Å¿o fume him, and this not only during his <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿icke,</hi> but at other times after, and let his drink be either Å¿weet maÅ¿hes or white water. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. Another, if your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> hath a new taken cold, then give him this Caudle, which I have often uÅ¿ed and do find it to be very good.</p>
                     <p>Take the yolkes of foure new layd Egges, and beate them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and diÅ¿Å¿olve them with a quart of good Ale, then take three good Nutmegs with a little AnniÅ¿eeds &amp; Licoras, made all into fine powder, and as much Pepper in fine powder as you can take up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Å¿ixpence; put theÅ¿e into the Ale, with a peece of Å¿weet Butter Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, and two Å¿poonefulls of ordinary Treacle, and of browne Sugar Candy foure ounces, warme all theÅ¿e upon the fire till the Treacle and Butter be molten, then give it him bloud warme, foure or five mornings together; and this is an infallible cure. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. Another very good.</p>
                     <p>Take a pottle of Å¿weet Wort, three heads of Garlick pilled, of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Honey halfe a pound. boyle theÅ¿e till one moiety bee conÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and give it your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> three mornings together: Then for three mornings together after, give him theÅ¿e Pills.

But if he hath a cold which breaketh and runneth from him, then muÅ¿t you be carefull to keepe his <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Pole</hi> warme, by putting on a double Hood, and every
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7066:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> Morning faÅ¿ting, ride him with two long GooÅ¿e-feathers put up into either <hi>NoÅ¿trill,</hi> well dipped before hand in Oyle de Bay, and with a Å¿trong Packthread from the ends of the quils faÅ¿tned over his <hi>head</hi> like a HeadÅ¿tall of a Bridle, Å¿o as the feathers may not get forth, and faÅ¿ten alÅ¿o to his Bit or Snaffle one Rooteor two of <hi>Polipodium;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene all night before laine Å¿teeped in the oyle of Spike, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time you ride him annoint the Bit thus before hand prepared with the Å¿aid Oyle, and when he commeth home, put upon his <hi>pole</hi> his double hood, and rub him againÅ¿t the hayre all over, eÅ¿pecially his <hi>Neck</hi> and <hi>Pole,</hi> (for friction in this caÅ¿e is moÅ¿t Å¿overaigne) then whilÅ¿t he is yet warme perfume his <hi>NoÅ¿e</hi> with FrankinÅ¿ence, Storax, and Beniamin, of each like much; do this nine daies together, and let his drinke be white water: for all Rhumes having had time to worke their malice will become dangerous, yea and many times cureleÅ¿Å¿e. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. Now if your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> hath taken an extreame cold; then:</p>
                     <p>Take Cloves, Nutmegges, Ginger, Galls, or the fruit of the Oake and Cardimums, of each like quantity Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, and of Fennell-Å¿eeds more than any one of the other Ingredients, make them into fine powder, and Å¿earce them, then put two Spoonefulls of this powder to a quart of Sack or muskadine, and Å¿traine theÅ¿e into two penny-worth of EngliÅ¿h Saffron, and the yelkes of two new laid Egges well beaten together, give this to your <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> bloud warme fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ting, and let him have none other drinke than white water for three or foure daies after, and let his Hay be Å¿prinkled with water, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day at noone give him the blades of reed, or the leaves of Sallows to eate out of your hand, for they be very good for him, and cooling for his <hi>body:</hi> do this divers mornings together, and it will not only cleanÅ¿e his Cold, but alÅ¿o open his Pipes, and Å¿et his wind at liberty. But if your <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> have an inward cold, which lyeth lurking in his <hi>Lunges</hi> or <hi>Stomacke,</hi> then give him this Medicine.</p>
                     <p>Take Oyle de Bay and good Tar, of each the quantity of three Wallnuts, halfe as much Hony, browne Sugar-candy in fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der halfe an ounce, mixe theÅ¿e with a quantity of powdred Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tone Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, and Å¿ew them into a fine linnen cloth, and ty it to his Bit or Snaffle, and Å¿o ride or journey him moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till all be diÅ¿Å¿olved into his <hi>body,</hi> then bring him into the Å¿table, and cloth and litter him warme, and three houres after give Hay, and after a warme MaÅ¿h; uÅ¿e him thus three mornings together and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if you Å¿hall Å¿ee cauÅ¿e. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take bloud from him, if you have ground for the Å¿ame, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e not,<note place="margin">Bran pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note> then inÅ¿teed of giving him Oates, you Å¿hall give him bran boyled in water after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Set a Kettle over the fire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t full of water, &amp; when it beginneth to boyle, put in your bran, and let it boyle a full quarter of an houre at leaÅ¿t, then take it off, and let it Å¿tand till it bee almoÅ¿t cold, and about foure or five a clocke in the morning, give him this Bran Å¿o hot as he can eate it; then for his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7066:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> drinke, give him the Å¿ame water, and at night give him Oates and white water, and let him be covered and littered warme; if it be in Summer, let not the Stable be too hot, for that will take away his <hi>Å¿tomacke,</hi> and make him faint and Å¿weat too much; and at night give him the quantity of what you can put into an Egge-Å¿hell among his Oates of this powder following, to which you muÅ¿t keep him for eight dayes together or longer, if you Å¿hall Å¿ee cauÅ¿e. You muÅ¿t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand that the boyled Branne is that which dryeth up all his groÅ¿Å¿e and corrupt <hi>humours,</hi> which was the cauÅ¿e of his cold. Now the powder is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Take of Comen-Å¿eed, Fenugrick, Silleris-Montani (<hi>alias</hi> SiÅ¿ileos) Nutmegs, Cloves, Ginger, LinÅ¿eed, of each two ounces, Quick BrimÅ¿tone Å¿ixe ounces, make all theÅ¿e into fine powder, and let them be well mixed: this muÅ¿t be given with his Oates, as is before inculcated; but he muÅ¿t firÅ¿t be watered; and then preÅ¿ently let him be well rubbed, <hi>body, necke, pole, legges, breaÅ¿t</hi> and <hi>belly,</hi> and cloathed and littered warme, and an houre before you give him his Oates, put into his Rack a little Å¿weet wheat Å¿traw, and Å¿o (I Å¿ay) let him eate thereof the Å¿pace of one houre or better, and then give him his Oates mixed with this powder, which having eaten, give him Hay at your pleaÅ¿ure; and thus doing in Å¿hort time you Å¿hall perceive his Cold to be quite gone, and the Å¿ooner if he Å¿hall be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ayered an houre after Sun-riÅ¿ing, and an houre before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿et, if the Sunne doe Å¿hine. Now if this Cold bring with it a violent cough, as is often Å¿een, then give him the aforeÅ¿aid Wheat Branne boyled, together with the Å¿aid powder with his Oates, but then not above three or foure dayes, for that the Å¿aid powder diÅ¿perÅ¿eth the corrupt and groÅ¿Å¿e <hi>humours</hi> that are in the <hi>body,</hi> which doe occaÅ¿ion the Å¿aid cough, and when you doe perceive that he hath purged Å¿uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, keep him notwithÅ¿tanding to his white water, but an houre before you doe water him;</p>
                     <p>Take a Å¿ticke of the bigneÅ¿Å¿e of your thumb or better, of well nigh a foot long, and wrap a linnen clout about it four or five times, firÅ¿t dipped in oyle de Bay, and put it into his <hi>mouth,</hi> and with Å¿ome piece of leather thong, or other Å¿mall cord faÅ¿ten it to either end of the Å¿ticke, and Å¿o faÅ¿ten it over his <hi>eares</hi> like the HeadÅ¿tall of a Bridle, like as Smiths uÅ¿e to do when they burn a HorÅ¿e for the Lampas, and let him drinke with this Å¿ticke in his mouth; which done, let him Å¿tand with it thus in his mouth an houre after at the leaÅ¿t, to the end he may licke and Å¿ucke up the Å¿aid oyle, and when he is to eate his Oates, put among them this other powder following, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take Fennell Å¿eed four ounces, Fenugrick two ounces, Cardimums one ounce, pound theÅ¿e groÅ¿ly, otherwiÅ¿e he will blow them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in eating his Oates, and with his Oates put every night of this powder one Å¿poonefull, and keep him warme, and Å¿o uÅ¿e him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is preÅ¿cribed. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> Another.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7066:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> Å¿o give it to your HorÅ¿e in Ale or Beere. This I never tryed, and this is onely for a cough. Another for a cough. Take of Å¿alt one pinte, of Sallet oyle halfe a pinte, oyle of AnniÅ¿eeds one ounce, browne Å¿ugar Candy, in powder three ounces, give this with your horne to your HorÅ¿e three mornings together, and it will rid him of his cough, and heale any putrifaction in his <hi>lungs,</hi> or any other inward parts whatÅ¿oever. This alÅ¿o I never tryed, but it was highly commended to me. Another Receit for a cough, which I have found to be very good.</p>
                     <p>Take two new laid Egges, and open the crownes, and get forth Å¿ome of the white, and then put into theÅ¿e Egges Å¿o much of the powder of BrimÅ¿tone as you can take up upon a Å¿hilling into either Egge: give him this every morning for Å¿ome time, or till you Å¿ee the cough to goe from him.

                     <p>Take Wheate meale, AnniÅ¿eeds, Licoris, Polipodium of the Oake dryed, Elecampane dryed: make all theÅ¿e into powder, and mixe them well: Take two Å¿poonfuls of this powder, with a head of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke pilled and bruized, mixe all theÅ¿e well together, and with your Wheate meale and honey as much as will Å¿uffice, make pils thereof to the bigneÅ¿Å¿e of a great Walnut, and give your HorÅ¿e every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning three or foure of theÅ¿e Pils, and Å¿o Å¿oone as he hath taken them, give him two new laid Egges with their Å¿hels. X Another:</p>

X This is right good, for I have had very great proofe thereof. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:</p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:7066:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>Take Benjamin and BrimÅ¿tone made into very fine powder, of each halfe an ounce, give this your HorÅ¿e with one pinte of Muskadine, putting into it two new laid Egges Å¿hels and all, broken and well beaten together, let it be given three mornings together.

X This I have found to be moÅ¿t Å¿overaigne for a HorÅ¿e that hath a cold whether newly or formerly taken, either wet or dry cough; it is alÅ¿o moÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for a HorÅ¿e that hath been over-ridden, or any way wronged by labour. Now if his cough be Å¿o violent as that it may endanger his <hi>winde;</hi> then,</p>
                     <p>Take Calamint, Gentiana, Comin-Å¿eed, Licoris, Elecampane, of each two drams, make all theÅ¿e into fine powder, and confect them with life Honey and Butter mingled together and molten; and when it is cold, make it up into Pils; then rowle them in the powder of AnniÅ¿eeds, and give him of theÅ¿e Pils three or foure every morning, for two or three mornings together faÅ¿ting, and after keep him warm, and let his drinke be MaÅ¿hes or White-water. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>.

                     <p>Take the leaves of Mullet, <hi>alias</hi> Mullen, <hi>alias</hi> HorÅ¿e-Lungwort, and dry them, and make them into fine powder, and then make them up in Bals or Pils with ordinary Hony Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice: let theÅ¿e Pils be made of the bigneÅ¿Å¿e of an Egge, and give him of them three at a time, fourteen or fifteen dayes together, or longer if you Å¿hall Å¿ee cauÅ¿e, and let him not drink any cold water, during the time,

                     <p>Sir, as touching this infirmity, I Å¿ay there is none Å¿uch, for you muÅ¿t underÅ¿tand that this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e Å¿o vulgarly called a <hi>broken wind,</hi> is truely a Å¿hortneÅ¿Å¿e of breath, or a taint or defect in the <hi>winde,</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iveneÅ¿Å¿e, the Asmat or PurtiÅ¿ick, as ArtiÅ¿ts doe call it. Three cauÅ¿es there be of this infirmity, two whereof proceed from a cold former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, and the third from another cauÅ¿e, as Å¿hall preÅ¿ently be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monÅ¿trated. The firÅ¿t is an exulceration of the lungs, which doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from a cold; the Å¿econd by clinging and growing together of the <hi>lights,</hi> whoÅ¿e origen came alÅ¿o of cold; and the third is a diÅ¿loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>lungs,</hi> and this laÅ¿t commeth by meanes of Å¿ome violent or Å¿udden act or motion of the body, or by Å¿ome fall whereby the <hi>lungs</hi> were become diÅ¿located, diÅ¿placed, or turned in the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> every of which doe occaÅ¿ion <hi>Å¿hortneÅ¿Å¿e of breath,</hi> by reaÅ¿on the lungs have not power Å¿ufficient (being the bellowes of the body) to open, Å¿hut, and play at pleaÅ¿ure; and this is the cauÅ¿e why the HorÅ¿e hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth at the <hi>ribs</hi> and <hi>flankes,</hi> fetcheth his breath Å¿hort and hot at the <hi>noÅ¿e,</hi> wheeÅ¿eth, and oft times reeleth when he is put to little that doth Å¿traine his <hi>winde,</hi> and therefore Å¿o long as he is kept in the Å¿table at dry and hard meats, he heaveth more then when he is at graÅ¿Å¿e, for if you doe waÅ¿h his Provender in Ale or Beere, and Å¿prinkle his Hay
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7066:85"/> with water, you Å¿hall perceive him to heave the leÅ¿Å¿e: but when he runneth at graÅ¿Å¿e, he heaveth Å¿o little, as hardly to be Å¿een, and the reaÅ¿on is, for that the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> having naturally a very moyÅ¿t body, the cold which he hath taken doth Å¿o condenÅ¿e and make thicke thoÅ¿e <hi>humours</hi> which before were thinne, which doe (whilÅ¿t they were <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues</hi>) paÅ¿Å¿e moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ily through the pores, but now they are become thick, viÅ¿cous, and Å¿limy, Å¿topping the pores in Å¿uch Å¿ort, as hardly to be able to <hi>breath,</hi> but with great labour and no leÅ¿Å¿e paine, which doth provoke him to heave and lift, by reaÅ¿on that the <hi>lungs, pores,</hi> and <hi>pipes</hi> are Å¿o Å¿topped and oppreÅ¿t, as not to be able to performe their function and naturall office, for which nature hath created them, and beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e Å¿toppings doe conÅ¿traine him to cough and labour Å¿o extreamely, as to endanger oft times the breaking of a <hi>veyne,</hi> from whence enÅ¿ue many more inconveniences then this one: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e you may have meanes to help his <hi>winde,</hi> but to recover him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Å¿ound againe, I dare not abÅ¿olutely promiÅ¿e you, and if you be Å¿olicitous to underÅ¿tand more of this Å¿ubject, to Å¿ave both your owne labour and mine, if you will be pleaÅ¿ed to peruÅ¿e MaÅ¿ter <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devile</hi> and MaÅ¿ter <hi>Markham,</hi> they are able to give you ample Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>

                     <p>We have two kindes of <hi>conÅ¿umptions,</hi> the firÅ¿t is called the dry malady, the other the conÅ¿umption of the <hi>fleÅ¿h:</hi> as touching the firÅ¿t, which commonly commeth at the firÅ¿t of a cold taken, then it exulcerateth the <hi>lungs,</hi> which in the beginning Å¿endeth forth thinne matter from the <hi>noÅ¿e,</hi> but after when it is growne more tough and viÅ¿cous, it runneth no more, but cauÅ¿eth a maceration and leanneÅ¿Å¿e through the whole <hi>body,</hi> whereby he droopeth and pineth away, and albeit he eateth and drinketh, yet it is without appetite, his meat doing him little good. The Å¿ignes to know it are theÅ¿e; his <hi>belly</hi> will be gaunt,<note place="margin">Dry Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> and he will be Hide-bound, his <hi>fleÅ¿h</hi> will conÅ¿ume almoÅ¿t to <hi>skinne</hi> and <hi>bones,</hi> if you Å¿trike him on the <hi>belly,</hi> it will Å¿ound hollow, his <hi>haire</hi> will Å¿tare, neither will he caÅ¿t it in due Å¿eaÅ¿on, when other <hi>HorÅ¿es</hi> which be Å¿ound will doe, he will cough hollow and faintly: the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> that is troubled with this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, well may he be kept for Å¿ome time alive, but long he cannot be, for the malady is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, if it be too long let runne, and therefore I leave him to Dogs and Crowes in his languiÅ¿hing plight. The other <hi>conÅ¿umption</hi> is that of the <hi>fleÅ¿h,</hi> which alÅ¿o beginneth of a cold formerly taken, which for want of remedy in time, occaÅ¿ioneth a generall diÅ¿like and macerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on throughout the whole body: it commeth from immoderate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or travell by violent heat and cold taken upon it: it commeth alÅ¿o by riding him into the water after a great heat given, and then
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7066:85"/> Å¿et up preÅ¿ently negligently; as once it hapned to a young <hi>Nagge</hi> of good mettell and Å¿pirit, and of very great hope, the owner of which <hi>Nagge</hi> delivered him to an <hi>Ambler</hi> to pace, who whilÅ¿t he had him in agitation, hearing Hounds abroad made in to them, who rodde him hard all day to the death of the Hare, then comming home hot and all in a Å¿weat, neere to the <hi>Amblers</hi> HouÅ¿e was a River with a Water-Mill, where he Å¿et him up to the skirts of the Saddle, &amp; then brought him into the Stable where was neyther cloath, litter, or other thing to keepe him warme, or wherewith to rub him, at which time hee tooke Å¿o deÅ¿perate a cold as never after to be cured: for in Å¿hort time after, he brought him to the <hi>Gentleman</hi> that did owne him, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his comming home the <hi>Nagge</hi> drooped, forÅ¿ooke his meate, and became very Å¿ick; the <hi>Gentleman</hi> deÅ¿ired me to endeavour the beÅ¿t I might for his recovery, for that he loved the <hi>Nagge</hi> well. I ignorant of the cauÅ¿e of his Malady, went as I thought according to Art, I tooke <hi>bloud</hi> from Å¿undry <hi>veines,</hi> I gave him a <hi>SuppoÅ¿itory,</hi> and after certaine <hi>ClyÅ¿ters,</hi> which I aÅ¿Å¿ured me were moÅ¿t needfull for him,<note place="margin">ConÅ¿um<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

And this I think fit to bring you for an inÅ¿tance, to the end you may be the more carefull in avoyding the like inconvenience, and be the better able to judge of a Malady of this nature.

                     <p>This diÅ¿eaÅ¿e hath an apparant ground more then conjecturall, for it never commeth to be knowne by any Å¿ymptomes, but onely when the <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> falleth into diÅ¿like, and loÅ¿eth the true and perfect colour of his hayre and skinne, and when he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth his <hi>Å¿pirit, mettle, Å¿trength, cheerefulneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and <hi>Å¿tomacke,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we Å¿ee it commeth principally for want of good nouriÅ¿hment and digeÅ¿ture, which paÅ¿Å¿eth into melancholy, it proceeding either from the <hi>Å¿pleene,</hi> or from the <hi>liver,</hi> or both, the <hi>bloud</hi> being corrupted, and converted into a thin and watry Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and Å¿ometimes it commeth of over-much reÅ¿t, for want of moderate exerciÅ¿e, which I doe judge to be the more probable. Some <hi>Ferriers</hi> doe affirme that there be three kindes of this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, but I could never obÅ¿erve more then one only, which hath its origen either of <hi>melancholy bloud water,</hi> or <hi>winde,</hi> but chiefly of water, by reaÅ¿on that the <hi>belly</hi> &amp; <hi>legs</hi> of a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> will Å¿well, and that a <hi>watry humour</hi> runnes 'twixt the <hi>skin</hi> and the <hi>fleÅ¿h,</hi> and if you lay your finger hard upon the Å¿wolne places, when you Å¿hall take it away, there will be in the place a pit for a Å¿mall time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

The cure is, firÅ¿t let him <hi>bloud,</hi> to take away the cold,<note place="margin">DropÅ¿ie.</note> thin watriÅ¿h or wheyiÅ¿h <hi>bloud,</hi> that better may come in its place, then cover him warme, and give him a Å¿weat in the Stable, but if he will not be brought to Å¿weat in the Stable (as many times it Å¿o falleth out) then exerciÅ¿e him abroad till he Å¿weat, and bring him into the Stable againe, and cloath and litter him warm, and let him be well rubbed, and give him Sallow leaves, or the leaves of the Elme tree greene, Rye blades, Sedge, or GraÅ¿Å¿e, to keep his <hi>body</hi> open, and when you doe give him Hay, let it be Å¿princkled with water; then give him this drinke:</p>

                     <p>AÅ¿Å¿uredly Sir the diÅ¿eaÅ¿es of the <hi>Liver</hi> are many, but yet the true and certaine grounds, how to diÅ¿cover them is beyond eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Ferriers</hi> skill to compaÅ¿Å¿e; nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e that there be many, and thoÅ¿e Å¿everall and diÅ¿tinct Infirmities in the <hi>Liver,</hi> no man needes make doubt: for if the <hi>Liver</hi> be eyther too hot, or too dry, too moiÅ¿t, or too cold, may eaÅ¿ily be diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed, which muÅ¿t needs occurre to the <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> eyther by intemperate riding or labour, or by evill foode, or by meanes of evill and corrupt <hi>humors,</hi> which do gather to the place, or by the overflowing of the <hi>Gall,</hi> or when <hi>Choler</hi> is predominate, it being cheifly ingendred through heat, like as cold begetteth <hi>Flegme,</hi> which cauÅ¿eth the Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e and ill diÅ¿poÅ¿ition of the <hi>Liver,</hi> together with its payne and anguiÅ¿h, whence proceede inflamations, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿tumations, Å¿toppings, obÅ¿tructions, knobs, yea and very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vlcers, every of which do cauÅ¿e the generall ConÅ¿umption and diÅ¿eaÅ¿e thereof. If the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e of the <hi>Liver</hi> do proceed from any hot cauÅ¿e, it is more eaÅ¿ie to bee diÅ¿covered, then if it came from any cold cauÅ¿e, for that it doth diÅ¿cover it Å¿elfe by theÅ¿e apparant Å¿ignes <hi>viz.</hi> He will bee leane and fall away of his <hi>fleÅ¿h,</hi> hee will loath his meate, and that which he eateth doth him little or no good, for want of ready digeÅ¿tion, his <hi>ordure</hi> wilbe very offenÅ¿ive, his thirÅ¿t great, and he will be verv much Å¿ubject to a looÅ¿eneÅ¿Å¿e: whereas on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿ide, if the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e ariÅ¿eth from any cold cauÅ¿e, you cannot diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it bv any of theÅ¿e Å¿ignes, for that he will be in very good liking &amp; Å¿tate of <hi>body,</hi> eate his meat with a good appetite, his <hi>excrements</hi> will

Now if a <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> be diÅ¿eaÅ¿ed in his <hi>liver,</hi> the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity muÅ¿t (I Å¿ay) proceed from an inflamation and impoÅ¿tumation, or from an ulcer. If it come from a cold cauÅ¿e, it cannot be an infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, nor an impoÅ¿tumation, for that theÅ¿e two doe both come from a hot cauÅ¿e, as all the learned doe know full well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of neceÅ¿Å¿ity it muÅ¿t be an <hi>ulcer</hi> which proceedeth from a cold cauÅ¿e, and the Å¿ignes to know it is, continuall coldneÅ¿Å¿e of his <hi>body,</hi> his <hi>hayre</hi> will Å¿tare, and he will be Å¿ubject to great feebleneÅ¿Å¿e, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e and debility of <hi>body,</hi> and the reaÅ¿on is, for that the exulcerated matter doth diffuÅ¿e throughout the whole <hi>body</hi> its evill vapours, which corrupteth and very much offendeth the <hi>heart</hi> in Å¿uch wiÅ¿e, whereby to occaÅ¿ion and haÅ¿ten the death of the poore beaÅ¿t: if in time the malady be not diÅ¿covered, and skilfully and by Art cured.

                     <p>Take of oyle de-Bay two ounces of Euforbium made into fine powder one ounce, incorporate both theÅ¿e Å¿o well together, that they may become but one body, then fearch for the firÅ¿t origin, or Å¿pring, where the firÅ¿t knots did begin, and Å¿o continue Å¿earching till you find out the laÅ¿t, clip away the <hi>hayre</hi> from off, and about all theÅ¿e knots, and annoynt them very well with this oyntment once every three dayes; and after you have thus dreÅ¿Å¿ed him three times, if you do not find the Farcins to be killed, and that the knots do not dry up, then bathe the places three dayes together with the Å¿tale or vrine of a Cowe, or Oxe, and with the hearbe called <hi>Lions foote,</hi> in latine, <hi>Leontipodium,</hi> both boyled together, and this will cure him. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>.

And two dayes after his <hi>bleeding,</hi> you Å¿hall begin to give him again his wheat bran prepared as before, which Å¿hall continue for Å¿ixe dayes together, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time you Å¿hall give him every evening with his Oats, this powder and theÅ¿e roots following, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Comin, of LinÅ¿eed, of Fenugrick, Sileris.

ThoÅ¿e dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended,</p>
                     <p>Take the root of Salerick, the root of TaÅ¿Å¿us-Barbatus, the root of Valerion, and the root of Lappaizon, of each like much, chop them all very Å¿mall, as hearbs to the pot, which being thus well mixed, give them to the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> without Oates if he will eate them, if not, then otherwiÅ¿e in Pils; and when you give him the roots, do not give him the aforeÅ¿aid powder, and Å¿o continue him with theÅ¿e roots Å¿ixe dayes together, which Å¿ixe dayes ended, cauÅ¿e him to be <hi>bloudied</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine on the other Å¿ide of the <hi>necke,</hi> but then let him not <hi>bleed</hi> Å¿o much as before, and order him as before after the firÅ¿t <hi>bleeding:</hi> nor Å¿hall you give him either powder or roots, but let him be Å¿till kept warm,

Of this my Å¿elfe had never tryall by reaÅ¿on that many of the ingredients were not eaÅ¿ily to be had. Another:</p>

                     <p>Truely Sir, in anÅ¿were to this, I by obÅ¿ervation of this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e do find, that there is but onely one kind, albeit I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,<note place="margin">Wet Farcin.</note> but that Å¿ome one may be more malignant then another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conÅ¿titution of the <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> who is viÅ¿ited therewith, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on that <hi>choler</hi> may be in that <hi>horÅ¿e,</hi> more predominant then in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>horÅ¿e,</hi> of any of the other <hi>humours,</hi> for then it commeth forth more dry, but if the <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> be naturally Rheumatick, then may it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more watry and moyÅ¿t, and Å¿o of the reÅ¿idue, but Å¿till it is but one, and the Å¿ame infirmity, for more Å¿orts I could never find. But touching this watry <hi>Farcin,</hi> as you are pleaÅ¿ed to terme the Å¿ame, the <hi>French</hi> giveth this name, <hi>viz. la Louppe,</hi> which is in <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> the <hi>Woulfe,</hi> and they gave me the reaÅ¿on why they do Å¿o call it, to wit; becauÅ¿e it feÅ¿treth the fleÅ¿h, eating and corroding therein inwardly, and it beginneth moÅ¿t commonly in the feet, rather then in any other member of the <hi>horÅ¿e.</hi> And for this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e a famous <hi>French MariÅ¿hall</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> gave me this enÅ¿uing cure, but I never yet made tryall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>FirÅ¿t waÅ¿h the place, and Å¿have away the hayre, and Å¿earch the place well with your finger, and let forth the corruption, but be Å¿ure you Å¿earch it to the very bottome.</p>
                     <p>Take then HorÅ¿e-dung, or GooÅ¿e-dung, Wine, Salt, and Vinegar of each Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, and make thereof a Å¿alve, and Å¿o PlayÅ¿ter-wiÅ¿e apply it to the Å¿orance, binding it on, and the third day open it, and dreÅ¿Å¿e it up againe as before, and do this every third day till it bee whole, but bee Å¿ure you doe every time you dreÅ¿Å¿e him, examine the very bottome. This he aÅ¿Å¿ured me to bee a very perfect Cute.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7066:119"/> to take Å¿udden cold therewith: alÅ¿o after a great heat taken, to be Å¿et up without exerciÅ¿e upon the cold Planks, without litter, or to be waÅ¿hed, or walked after great labour, the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> being very hot and ketty, (for this infirmity falleth moÅ¿t commonly upon fat <hi>HorÅ¿es,</hi> but very Å¿eldome upon leane) alÅ¿o to water your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> in Å¿hallow places, or waters where the water aÅ¿cends not higher then his <hi>paÅ¿ternes,</hi> by which meanes through the Å¿udden coldneÅ¿Å¿e of the water at his <hi>feet,</hi> cauÅ¿eth the <hi>molten greaÅ¿e</hi> deÅ¿cending unto the <hi>feet,</hi> to cake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geale, which is the prime ground of this malady. And this not onely my Å¿elfe, but all the moÅ¿t perite <hi>Ferriers</hi> doe with an unanimous aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent acknowledge. And therefore I doe admoniÅ¿h you and every man, who is the <hi>HorÅ¿es</hi> friend,</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t, to be very carefull not to exerciÅ¿e his <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> too Å¿oon after his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> taking up from graÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, whilÅ¿t he is very fat; that he doe not over-travaile, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-labour, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or over-toyle him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that having travelled hard, and to prevent his <hi>foundring,</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> let him be more gently ridden an houre before he commeth to his lodging, to the end he may be choole, and the more free from danger.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if one houre before you get to your lodging, you ride <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> him into Å¿ome River, or other watring place up to the <hi>belly,</hi> (but not deeper) then water him by degrees, Å¿till betwixt every draught, Å¿tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and removing him a little, it would not be amiÅ¿Å¿e; but then Å¿o Å¿oon as you be come forth of the water, it were very good you did continue him in the Å¿ame pace, going neither faÅ¿ter or Å¿lower, (like as I have before inculcated) it will be the better alÅ¿o, and your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> out of danger of <hi>foundring.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, forbeare evermore (eÅ¿pecially if your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> be heated) to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> water him in any Å¿hallow place.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, beÅ¿ides his being warme Å¿et up with litter enough, let him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> have Å¿tore of rubbing, as well of his <hi>legges</hi> as <hi>body,</hi> for it is a moÅ¿t wholeÅ¿ome thing, it diÅ¿Å¿olveth molten greaÅ¿e very much, and it doth diÅ¿Å¿iipate and Å¿end away bad <hi>humours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>LaÅ¿tly, picking and Å¿topping of his <hi>feet</hi> in time of journeying, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> after is very good and profitable. And thus have I Å¿hewed by what meanes this malady commeth to the <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> howÅ¿oever many other wayes there are, which I have touched, by reaÅ¿on they are Å¿o vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly known to every man, and therefore your Å¿elfe cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them.</p>

A <hi>galled backe</hi> commeth commonly either with the Saddle, the Pannell, Pack-Saddle or Male-pillion, which through evill Å¿top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or defect of Å¿topping, may very eaÅ¿ily gall the <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> Å¿o alÅ¿o may the fault be in the tree, which may be Å¿o badly made, Å¿o as that let the Saddler be never Å¿o Å¿ufficient, skilfull, or carefull, yet Å¿hall it both gall and hurt him; Å¿o alÅ¿o may the tree of the Saddle be either broken or crackt, if it at any time happen, be you then confident, that it can never be Å¿o amended or repaired, but that doe what you can it Å¿hall hurt the back of the <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> and theÅ¿e be the moÅ¿t frequent and ordinary wayes, whereby to gall the back of your <hi>horÅ¿e,</hi> howbeit I paÅ¿Å¿e over Male-pillions, Cloake-bags, Port-mantues, TruÅ¿Å¿es, and the like. The Å¿ignes to know a galled back are eaÅ¿ie, for either the backe will be apparantly Å¿welled, or the hayre fretted off, the skinne either broken or raw, or the backe either inflamed or impoÅ¿tumated, every of which is eaÅ¿ily to be determined by the eye, or if his <hi>backe</hi> be wrung with the Saddle, and yet not come to be viÅ¿ible to the eye, yet may you come to the knowledge therof, if taking off the Saddle, Å¿troking your hand all along the back, you Å¿hall perceive him either to Å¿hake his head, or to winch with his tayle, to rouze, or Å¿hake, to Å¿tamp or Å¿trike with his feet, to offer to bite, or the like, whereby you may come to know it, and very eaÅ¿ily to finde out the place grieved.

                     <p>With all my heart Sir. As touching this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e which we doe call the <hi>Glanders,</hi> it is of all others the worÅ¿t, noyÅ¿ome, and moÅ¿t infectious, inÅ¿omuch as that <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> that hath it, if he be not removed and Å¿eparated from his fellowes, will infect Å¿o many as Å¿hall be with him in the Å¿ame Stable and roome. To finde out the depth, root, and true nature of this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, I have greatly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, as alÅ¿o how to cure the Å¿ame. I have alÅ¿o had much confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with many the moÅ¿t famous and exquiÅ¿ite <hi>MariÅ¿hals</hi> and <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> abroad, and I have Å¿een very much of their practiÅ¿e therein, Å¿o al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o have I had very Å¿erious diÅ¿courÅ¿es with a number of our beÅ¿t Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers and Smiths at home, but I finde not one in twenty can Å¿peake truely to any purpoÅ¿e of the nature of this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, and therefore I do not wonder that they cannot cure a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e whereof they are Å¿o much to Å¿eek. NevertheleÅ¿Å¿e what I do underÅ¿tand of this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, I will ingenuouÅ¿ly deliver unto you. The <hi>Glanders</hi> is an infirmity which proceedeth firÅ¿t of cold taken, which being neglected, will in time come to be the <hi>Glanders;</hi> you Å¿hall firÅ¿t perceive it by the inflamed kernels and knots which may be felt under the <hi>chaule</hi> of the <hi>horÅ¿e,</hi> and as they doe grow in bigneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿o do the <hi>Glanders</hi> grow and increaÅ¿e within the body of the <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> which firÅ¿t beginning with a thin Rhume, aÅ¿cendeth up to the head, and Å¿ettleth neer to the brain, and Å¿o venteth it Å¿elfe at the noÅ¿e, which yet may be eaÅ¿ily cured, as I have before inculcated, where I entreated of Colds, afterwards it growes thicker, and then it is worÅ¿e to cure, but yet faiÅ¿able enough, in longer time it commeth yet to a thicker Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and its colour is yellowiÅ¿h, much like unto Butter, and then it is more hard to cure, but yet curable, albeit that now it is come to be a perfect <hi>Glanders:</hi> but when it commeth to be of a viÅ¿cous, and of a tough and Å¿limy Å¿ubÅ¿tance, and of a green colour, and to Å¿tink terribly, and that it hath now runne Å¿ome moneths, or peradventure halfe a yeer or better, as alÅ¿o having Å¿ome Å¿mall Å¿pecks of a reddiÅ¿h colour in it, then is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ferriers work or Art to cure the Å¿ame, for in a caÅ¿e of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ableÅ¿t Ferrier may receive the foyle, and the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> dye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hands and cure, as I have often by experience been an eye witneÅ¿Å¿e, albeit there hath been no defect in the Ferrier, either in Art, induÅ¿try, care or diligence. I doe therefore averre that I would not have any man (be he never Å¿o expert an ArtiÅ¿t) to promiÅ¿e to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7066:129"/> the cure of every <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> he Å¿hall take in hand, by the reaÅ¿on that the <hi>Glanders</hi> it Å¿elfe is the thing he muÅ¿t cure, but in taking upon him o cure that malady, he muÅ¿t before he can have perfected his cure, cure him alÅ¿o of many other diÅ¿eaÅ¿es, which the <hi>Glanders</hi> will bring along with it, as <hi>(v. g.)</hi> the conÅ¿umption of the fleÅ¿h and lungs, griefes and aches in the head and braine, inflamations under the <hi>chaule,</hi> diÅ¿eaÅ¿es in the liver, purÅ¿iveneÅ¿Å¿e, hide-bound, dropÅ¿ie, Å¿wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led legges, and many other infirmities too prolixe to repeat, all which (I Å¿ay) are inherent to the <hi>Glanders,</hi> and its origine that it is of cold paÅ¿t all peradventure, howÅ¿oever it Å¿ometimes commeth of Surfets, Å¿ometimes of Morfounding, Å¿ometimes by infection, all which (the laÅ¿t only excepted) taketh its firÅ¿t Å¿ource from cold, and when it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (as before I Å¿aid) greeniÅ¿h with reddiÅ¿h Å¿pecks, accompanied alÅ¿o with an offenÅ¿ive or Å¿tinking breath, then are his lungs ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by meanes whereof the cure is the more deÅ¿perate and difficile. I do therefore adviÅ¿e all Ferriers my brethren, who Å¿hall at any time take upon them this cure, that they doe firÅ¿t prepare the body of the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> with Å¿uch preparatives and PhyÅ¿icke, as are meet to expell his peccant humours, which muÅ¿t be alÅ¿o very carefully adminiÅ¿tred, yea and that according to the Å¿trength and ability of the <hi>HorÅ¿e:</hi> for the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> cannot chooÅ¿e but be feeble and weake, having of a long time before viÅ¿ited with a Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e of this nature, yea peradventure a whole yeere or two before together, during which time he hath continually waÅ¿ted and languiÅ¿hed, wherefore he cannot be Å¿trong, but a very weake <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> and therefore his phyÅ¿icke muÅ¿t be very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet Å¿uch alÅ¿o which may have operation whereby to work, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e phyÅ¿icke is but caÅ¿t away. The Å¿ignes how to know this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e need no further deÅ¿cription, and therefore I will proceed to the cure, for the which I will deliver you many receits, Å¿ome whereof I have well experienced, to which I will give my particular marke, like as I have formerly done. And I do the rather inÅ¿ert the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, becauÅ¿e (as I have before remembred) that receit which will not cure one, will cure another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Glanders.</note>The firÅ¿t therefore that is to be done in this caÅ¿e, is, to prepare his body by giving him for four or five dayes together, in Å¿tead of his Oates and Provender, wheat Bran prepared, like as I have before Å¿hewed you in the caÅ¿es of Å¿ick <hi>HorÅ¿es,</hi> eÅ¿pecially in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.

It commeth either through the negligence of the <hi>Groome</hi> for default of rubbing, and due and orderly dreÅ¿Å¿ing, or elÅ¿e from the corruption of the <hi>bloud</hi> through hard and immoderate riding; and thoÅ¿e <hi>horÅ¿es</hi> are moÅ¿t eÅ¿pecially Å¿ubject thereunto, which have long <hi>hayre</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all along the <hi>legges</hi> from the <hi>paÅ¿terne</hi> up to the top of the <hi>thigh</hi> as moÅ¿t commonly have your <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Freeze-land horÅ¿es,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on that the <hi>hayre</hi> in that place, being thick, long, and Å¿haggy, doth gather Å¿and, durt, and other filth, which not being continually taken off by the induÅ¿try of his <hi>Keeper,</hi> will Å¿cald, burne, and fret into the joynt, and Å¿o breed this kinde of Å¿orance. I have already Å¿hewed you the Å¿ignes how to know it, now I will alÅ¿o give you very many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits wherewith to cure it, many of which are Å¿peciall good. FirÅ¿t therefore (whatÅ¿oever you have to apply unto this Å¿orance) faile not to waÅ¿h and Å¿have away the hayre from off and about the Å¿orances; firÅ¿t then</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Malender.</note>Take blacke Sope, Vnguentum Populeon, and freÅ¿h Butter, of each like much as will Å¿uffice: mixe them well together, and Å¿o bring them to a formall Vnguent, and apply it to the Å¿orance every other day till it be whole. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> But you muÅ¿t withall underÅ¿tand that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e you doe picke away and rubbe off the dry cruÅ¿t or Å¿curfe, as well as waÅ¿h and Å¿have away the hayre which doth annoy the Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, you doe nothing in the perfecting of the Cure, for be you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident unleÅ¿Å¿e you doe this, the <hi>Malender</hi> will not be taken away, nor any medicine that you Å¿hall apply to it, be able to heale it up. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:</p>
                     <p>Take blacke Å¿ope, and allay it with Buck-lye, and waÅ¿h the place
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7066:148"/> well therewith: this done, apply unto the Å¿orance a plaiÅ¿ter of GooÅ¿e-dung, and renew it twice a day till it be whole. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> Another:</p>
                     <p>Take quick-Å¿ilver, and kill it in Orpiment, then take Buck-lye, and mixe ordinary durt which lyeth in the Å¿treet (wherein muÅ¿t be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿tones nor gravell) with the Buck-lye, Quick-Å¿ilver, and Orpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and herewith annoynt the Å¿orance twice a day if need be, and when the oyntment is well rubbed in, then clap a plaiÅ¿ter of the Å¿ame medicine to the griefe every time you do annoynt it. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take of the Å¿trongeÅ¿t white Wine Vineger, and boyle it, and Å¿o boyling hot, rub the Malender therewith twice every day till it doe bleed, that done, put upon it the powder of Verdigrece good and thicke, and Å¿o binde it on with a clout, and let it Å¿o remaine till a cruÅ¿t come thereon, and when you Å¿hall finde the cruÅ¿t to be dry, and withall to chop, annoynt the grieved place with tryed Hogs greaÅ¿e, and that will cauÅ¿e the cruÅ¿t to fall off, and the Å¿ore to heale up. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is is a moÅ¿t excellent Cure, and it did never faile me.

                     <p>Rub the Å¿ore with the oyle of Hemp-Å¿eed, or with the oyle of Nuts, or with Å¿harp MuÅ¿tard, but the oyle of Hemp-Å¿eed is the very beÅ¿t if it may be had. This was taught me by a <hi>French MariÅ¿hall,</hi> but I never made tryall thereof. Another:</p>
                     <p>FirÅ¿t rub off the outward Å¿curfe till it <hi>bleed,</hi> then binde upon the place this medicine; take of blacke Sope, and of Quick-Å¿ilver morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with faÅ¿ting Å¿pittle as much as will Å¿uffice, and Å¿o worke them to a Å¿alve, and plaiÅ¿ter-wiÅ¿e binde it to the Å¿orance, renewing it every day once till it be killed, and after heale up the Å¿ore with freÅ¿h or Å¿weet Butter. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Glovers Å¿hreds</hi> which he cutteth from his white leather, and hoyle them in <hi>Vineger</hi> of the beÅ¿t and Å¿trongeÅ¿t till they be Å¿oft, binde this to the <hi>malender</hi> very hot, and it will perfectly cure the Å¿ame. I did never make tryall thereof, but it was given me for very good. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take the fat or lard of Bacon one pound, red Lead, Verdegrece and Lethurge of gold, of each two ounces, make them all into fine powder, and boyle them well together with the Å¿aid fat of Bacon, keeping them in the boyling continually Å¿tirring; then having very well cleanÅ¿ed the Å¿ore, and made it raw, annoynt it with this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine morning and evening till it be cleane dryed up. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good.

It is Å¿o eaÅ¿ie to be diÅ¿covered, as that it needs no other deÅ¿cription, then what hath beene already Å¿hewed: and I will give you many good Receipts for this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Mainge.</note>Take Spurge, Selendine, BrimÅ¿tone, all in fine powder, of each three ounces, Hogge-greaÅ¿e tryed, new-Wax, Sheeps-Å¿uet, &amp; quick-Silver well mortified with faÅ¿ting-Å¿pitle, of each two ounces, melt and incorporate all theÅ¿e together, and Å¿o bring them to an oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then firÅ¿t waÅ¿h and make raw the places infected with Å¿tale V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine and greene Copperas boyled together, the infected places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿craped, and made raw with a Curry-combe or Å¿ome Å¿uch like thing, and then annoynt him with this Vnguent, but firÅ¿t of all you muÅ¿t take <hi>bloud</hi> from the <hi>Neck-veine,</hi> the day before you dreÅ¿Å¿e him with this Vnguent. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. This is one of the beÅ¿t Recepts for a <hi>Mainge</hi> that I have, and with it I have done very many rare Cures.</p>
                     <p>Take the rootes of Elecampane newly gathered, and the rootes of red Dockes, of each like much, Å¿lice and cut them thin, and put unto unto them of Chamber-ly three quarts, and of Bay-Å¿alt, one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: boyle theÅ¿e till one quart be comÅ¿umed, then take it off, and with a rag faÅ¿tned to the end of a Å¿tick, waÅ¿h the places infected very hot, you having firÅ¿t made the places raw, with an old Curry-combe, OyÅ¿ter-Å¿hell, &amp;c. VÅ¿e this foure or five mornings together, then
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7066:149"/> Å¿ome three mornings after annoynt the places greived with this Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Take quick-Silver one ounce, let it bee well mortified in faÅ¿ting Å¿pittle, and mix with it Å¿o much Hogs-greaÅ¿e as a Hens Eg, or better: then take powder of BrimÅ¿tone, Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all theÅ¿e very well together, and annoynt all the Maingy places therewith till they bee perfectly whole. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. This is very good. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take of the Oyle of Pilchards, and of Chamber-ly of each one quart, Guinny powder, and the powder of BrimÅ¿tone, of each three ounces, white Wine-Vinegar one pint, boyle all theÅ¿e together till they bee thicke, make the places raw, and annoynt them therewith three times in nine dayes, that is to Å¿ay, every three daies once, and this will cure him. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. This is very good, but you muÅ¿t not forget evermore for this Malady, to take Å¿tore af <hi>bloud</hi> from your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> a day or two before you do adminiÅ¿ter any thing unto him, for untill Å¿uch time as the <hi>Melancholy</hi> &amp; <hi>corrupt-bloud</hi> be firÅ¿t let out, he will not eaÅ¿ily be cured. Another for a Mainge, Itch, or Running Scab, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Take as much Auripigmentum finely powdred, and mixed with Hogges-greaÅ¿e as will bring it to be yellowiÅ¿h, but not too yellow a colour, annoynt the places infected therewith, and it will kill it in three or foure dreÅ¿Å¿ings: This Vuguent will take away both the Scab and <hi>hayre</hi> together: but have you no feare, for it will not be long ere new <hi>hayre</hi> will come in it's place. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. With this receipt I have cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very many <hi>horÅ¿es,</hi> who have not beene a little over-run with this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e. Another,</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t day let him <hi>bloud</hi> on the left Å¿ide of the <hi>Neck,</hi> then two daies after open the other <hi>Veine,</hi> and three daies after that let him <hi>bloud</hi> on both the <hi>Spurre-Veines,</hi> and laÅ¿tly, two daies after that under the <hi>Tayle,</hi> and let him <hi>bleed</hi> in every of theÅ¿e <hi>Veines,</hi> then Å¿carrifie all the places and waÅ¿h them with new Brine made very Å¿alt: that done annoynt the places with this Vuguent.</p>
                     <p>Take of quick-Silver one ounce, tryed Hogs-greaÅ¿e one pound, BrimÅ¿tone made into fine powder foure ounces, Rape-oyle one pint. FirÅ¿t kill the quick-Å¿ilver with faÅ¿ting-Å¿pittle, and then incorporate them together throughly with all the other Ingredients, and having annoynted all the raw places with this Oyntment, cauÅ¿e it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Å¿inke in by holding a barre of hot iron neere to the places, and then touch him no more in three daies after, and evermore when you dreÅ¿Å¿e him, forget not firÅ¿t to rub and Å¿carrifie the places infected till they do begin to bleed; but if all this will not avayle, then burne the rankeÅ¿t places of the Mainge with an iron, having a button on the end thereof, but then take heed you enter not the <hi>fleÅ¿h,</hi> but beare your hand light upon the <hi>skin</hi> only, and let each hole be well-nigh a Å¿pan from the other. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This I have often uÅ¿ed.

                     <p>Take of Chamber-ly foure quarts, Bay-Å¿alt foure handfuls, boyle them well together, and waÅ¿h the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> therewith, Å¿o hot as hee can well Å¿uffer it, and when he is well waÅ¿hed; take Neats-foote oyle and put it into water, and beate them well together, and therewith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the raw places, and in foure or five times thus doing, he will be well. This Å¿eemes to a good cure, but I do not remember that I ever did uÅ¿e it. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take Mother of Salt-Peter, the beÅ¿t &amp; Å¿trongeÅ¿t, and waÅ¿h the Å¿ores therewith Å¿o hot as the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> is able to Å¿uffer it, and in three or foure times dreÅ¿Å¿ing it, will cure him. This I never tryed, but the party that taught it me, averred that it would not only kill any <hi>Mainge,</hi> but all Scratches, Paines, Rats-tayles, &amp;c. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take Sopers-lees, and firÅ¿t make the <hi>Maingy</hi> places raw, and after waÅ¿h them with the Å¿aid Sopers-le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s, and in once or twice dreÅ¿Å¿ing, he will be well. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. This was taught me by the moÅ¿t able <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> I do now know living in <hi>England</hi> and I have often uÅ¿ed it, and I have done with it very many great Cures. It cureth the <hi>Mainge</hi> both in <hi>HorÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Dogges,</hi> provided they get not to it with their mouth and teeth. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take Hogges-greaÅ¿e halfe a pound, Oyle de Bay one ounce and halfe, Crude-Mercury, and white Elebore, of each one ounce, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate theÅ¿e well together, and firÅ¿t make the places raw, &amp; then annoynt them with the Å¿aid Oyntment. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>.

                     <p>Take of Hempe-Å¿eed, and of Mutton-Å¿uet, of each one pound, bray the Hempe-Å¿eed merveylous well in a Morter, then take of old Bores-greaÅ¿e one pound, VerdegreaÅ¿e, Quick-Å¿ilver, Elebore, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, Tartar, of each foure drams, &amp; of BrimÅ¿tone three ounces, make all into very fine powder, that is to be powdred, and mix them well, making them into one <hi>body,</hi> and then diÅ¿Å¿olve them upon a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is a moÅ¿t Å¿overaigne receipt for this malady, for I have had great proofe thereof. Another whereby to cure the <hi>Mainge</hi> in the <hi>Maine</hi> or <hi>Tayle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Make AÅ¿hes of the hearb called <hi>AbÅ¿cinthus,</hi> Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, quick-lime, &amp; Soot, of each Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice: mingle all theÅ¿e together, and with warm water make a Ly thereof, with which you Å¿hall waÅ¿h the <hi>Maine</hi> and <hi>Tayle</hi> in the places infected, &amp; this Ly will not only cure this Malady, but alÅ¿o cauÅ¿e the <hi>hayre</hi> to grow againe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faÅ¿t. This was taught me by a very good <hi>MariÅ¿hall</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> but I cold never make uÅ¿e thereof, by reaÅ¿on the hearbe <hi>AbÅ¿cinthus</hi> was hard to get here. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take a little BrimÅ¿tone, MaÅ¿culine-FrankinÅ¿ence, Niter of Tartar,

                     <p>You muÅ¿t firÅ¿t Å¿crape the <hi>leprous</hi> places till they do bleed; then take of Vineger one pinte, white Elebore, Cantharides, Euforbium, of each one ounce, make all theÅ¿e into fine powder, and boyle them all well together, and apply it very hot to the place grieved, then when the Å¿curfe or cruÅ¿t is fallen away, waÅ¿h the Å¿orance with Buck-lye mixed with black Sope, and it will be well. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is a Å¿peciall good receit.

This I had of a <hi>French MariÅ¿hall,</hi> but becauÅ¿e I could never finde the hearb <hi>Ouraige,</hi> I did never make tryall thereof. Another:</p>
                     <p>Take of white Wine Vineger halfe a pinte, Cantharides in fine powder, one ounce, boyle them together, and boyling hot apply it to the Å¿orance, and your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> will Å¿ooner be cured. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This I have often tryed, and it is very good.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have delivered you many receits for this one malady, which we call the <hi>mainge,</hi> moÅ¿t of them I have tryed, and can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e them to be Å¿peciall good, whereof many will not onely cure the <hi>mainge</hi> in the <hi>body</hi> it Å¿elfe, but in the <hi>mayne</hi> and <hi>tayle</hi> alÅ¿o if you pleaÅ¿e to make uÅ¿e of them.</p>
                     <p>Another moÅ¿t excellent receit for the <hi>mainge?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take Lithurgie of gold, two pound, beat it to very fine powder, and Å¿earce it through a fine Å¿earcer, and put it into a glaÅ¿Å¿e which will hold a potttle; then put thereto of the Å¿trongeÅ¿t and beÅ¿t white Wine Vineger that can be gotten, three pintes or better, and for foure and twenty hours after, Å¿hake it together ever and anone, but the firÅ¿t time it muÅ¿t be beaten or Å¿haken a good time together, to wit, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre at the leaÅ¿t without intermiÅ¿Å¿ion, and then let it Å¿ettle, and Å¿o keep it in the Å¿ame glaÅ¿Å¿e cloÅ¿e Å¿topped for your uÅ¿e. Now when you would uÅ¿e the medicine, you muÅ¿t make it into a Å¿alve af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: Take of the oyle of RoÅ¿es two ounces, and of the cleereÅ¿t of the Å¿aid Vineger in the glaÅ¿Å¿e (which muÅ¿t not have any of the Lithurgie in it) two ounces alÅ¿o; beat theÅ¿e together with a wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Å¿platter, untill you have brought it into a thick Å¿alve: Take then of Quick-Å¿ilver the weight of a Å¿hilling, and firÅ¿t mortifie it very well in a little of the Å¿irrup of Damaske RoÅ¿es, the quantity of Å¿ixe or eight drops, and about three or four drops of the Å¿pirit or oyle of Turpentine; with the Å¿irrup and oyle, mingle and work theÅ¿e things well untill the Quick-Å¿ilver be very well mortified, then mixe it well with the former Å¿alve, and then put it up into a cleane gally-pot, and Å¿o keep it; and firÅ¿t making the places raw, annoynt them with theÅ¿e Vnguents, and it will kill any <hi>mainge</hi> in the <hi>body, mayne,</hi> or <hi>tayle.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good. Another very good.</p>
                     <p>Take of Tarre a gallon, of tryed Hogs greaÅ¿e, and Bolearmoniack of each two pound, of Pepper one pound, beat the Pepper and Bole-armoniacke to very fine powder, and then mixe all the ingredients together, making them into one body, then firÅ¿t Å¿crape the Å¿orance, Å¿o as you doe raiÅ¿e the Å¿curfe and dry cruÅ¿ty Å¿tuffe, but not to make it raw, or to bleed much, and then annoint all the places infected, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and chafing it in very well, as if it be in winter, let one hold a barre of hot iron neer to the places as you annoint and chafe it in; but
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7066:151"/> if in Summer, the Å¿unne will do it much better as he runneth at graÅ¿Å¿e; and thus dreÅ¿Å¿e him every three dayes Å¿o long as the unguent laÅ¿teth, and he will be cured. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is an approved cure.</p>
                     <p>Another. To perform this cure, the beÅ¿t way is, to give the fire to the place after this manner: the iron being hot, firÅ¿t draw it along either Å¿ide of the chinke, then draw it upon the top of the chink, then draw three Å¿trakes (if need Å¿o require) overthwart, and in Å¿hort time the hoofe will grow again, Å¿o as the chink will be cloÅ¿ed, and remain Å¿ound and whole. And over and above, you may exerciÅ¿e him that very next day after you have thus given him the fire, provided his exerciÅ¿e be not upon hard, but upon Å¿oft or Å¿andy ground. X This is a very able cure taught me by a Å¿ingular <hi>MariÅ¿hall</hi> of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and I have practiÅ¿ed the Å¿ame upon Å¿undry good <hi>horÅ¿es</hi> here in <hi>England.</hi>

                        <hi>Morfounding</hi> is but the <hi>French</hi> word: Å¿igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying melting of greaÅ¿e or <hi>foundring</hi> in the <hi>body,</hi> whereof I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿ufficiently intreated; nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e I will give you for this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady two Å¿ingular receits, the one I had of an <hi>Italian rider</hi> in <hi>BruÅ¿Å¿els,</hi> and the other of a <hi>French MariÅ¿hall</hi> in <hi>Avinion,</hi> a man eÅ¿teemed moÅ¿t famous, and of both thoÅ¿e receits I have made often uÅ¿e, and I have perfected them for moÅ¿t rare cures. That which the <hi>Italian</hi> taught me is this; firÅ¿t open the <hi>necke veyne,</hi> and draw away the inflamed and corrupt bloud, then take of white Wine one pinte, Sallet oyle halfe a pinte, of Rhubarb and of Aloes, of each two drams, of Senae halfe an ounce, of Agarick three drams, Bay berries halfe an ounce, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faron two drams, Duck or Duke powder, and of cordiall powder, of each two drams, make what is to be powdred into very fine powder, and mixe them well together, adding thereunto of life Honey foure ounces, all which being made warme upon the fire, and well brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, give it your <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> bloud warme, but you muÅ¿t withall underÅ¿tand that the Å¿ame day you Å¿hall adminiÅ¿ter this drink unto
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7066:152"/> him, he do Å¿tand faÅ¿ting upon the Trench three or foure houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and as many after; neither muÅ¿t you the Å¿ame day give him any Oates, and let his drink be either a Å¿weet MaÅ¿h, or white water, and keep him warm, and with white water five or Å¿ixe dayes after, and then give him Oates, but in tthe interim in Å¿tead of Oates, let him have either bread made for him of purpoÅ¿e, or elÅ¿e Bran prepared; and when you do give him Oates, put in amongÅ¿t them Fenugrick bruiÅ¿ed. X This is I do aÅ¿Å¿ure you a moÅ¿t excellent receit, with which I Å¿aved the life, and brought to perfect Å¿anity a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> of price, which was viÅ¿ited with this infirmity; the Å¿econd receit which I had of the <hi>MariÅ¿hall</hi> of <hi>Avinion</hi> is this; <hi>(viz)</hi> Å¿o Å¿oon as you doe perceive or Å¿uÅ¿pect him to be <hi>morfounded,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Salt one handfull, and put to it of faire water one pinte, and give it him to drink, and ride him moderately upon it till he <hi>Å¿weate,</hi> and this will cure him if it be adminiÅ¿tred Å¿o Å¿oon as you may Å¿uÅ¿pect the malady, but if you Å¿tay three or foure dayes, or longer, before you doe give him this water and Å¿alt, then take of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Hellebore one Å¿poonfull, and of Saffaron one penny worth, of AÅ¿Å¿afaetida, and of Sope of Venice, of each two drams, of Bacca <hi>alias</hi> the Å¿eeds of Bayes, a farthing worth made alÅ¿o into fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, mixe and pound all theÅ¿e together well, putting to them of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger one pinte, and give it him bloud warme, then cover him with a wet cloth, and clothe him warme, and Å¿et him upon the Trench, that he may neither lye down, nor vomit, but let him Å¿weat an hour after, and then coole and dry him by degrees, and let him be well rubbed, and he will doe well again.

                        <hi>guts,</hi> being of nature and condition more gentle then <hi>CliÅ¿ters</hi> are, and may be applyed when <hi>CliÅ¿ters</hi> cannot. It therefore remaineth that the skill of the <hi>Ferrier</hi> be Å¿uch, as to be able judiciouÅ¿ly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand the Å¿everall natures of every of theÅ¿e things, to know how to make choice of his ingredients and Å¿imples aptly, to underÅ¿tand how to compound them punctually and artificially, to diÅ¿cern rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he do adminiÅ¿ter what be the <hi>humours</hi> and maladies wherewith the <hi>creature</hi> is annoyed and viÅ¿ited, as whether <hi>(V.

The fift and laÅ¿t way of <hi>purging</hi> is by graÅ¿Å¿e, eÅ¿pecially if the <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> be <hi>Å¿urfetted,</hi> and hath been over-toyled the Winter before, for this muÅ¿t be done in the <hi>Summer</hi> time, when graÅ¿Å¿e is in its beÅ¿t heart; but that graÅ¿Å¿e which will Å¿coure and purge moÅ¿t, is a new mown meadow, for that will rake his <hi>guts</hi> very well, nor will he in Å¿uch a place gather fleÅ¿h; I do therefore counÅ¿ell you not to Å¿uffer him to remain in Å¿uch grounds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fourteen or fifteen dayes, and then take him forth, and put him into Å¿ome other paÅ¿ture, where the graÅ¿Å¿e hath not been touched with the <hi>Sithe,</hi> for then he will <hi>belly</hi> well, and in Å¿hort time recover much <hi>fleÅ¿h,</hi> and become fat and luÅ¿ty.

                     <p>Take of common-Hony, and of Verdegrece in fine powder, of each Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, boyle this till it bee red, and therewith <hi>Taint</hi> the wound till it be whole, keeping evermore the <hi>mouth</hi> of the wound open, leaÅ¿t it heale up above before it be well healed at the bottome, neyther let your <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> come into any wet, or go forth of the Stable untill he be throughly cured. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>.

                     <p>Truely Sir, for any man to promiÅ¿e that, were great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, onely thus far he may wade therein, as to give eaÅ¿e and help to a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> that hath the <hi>rot,</hi> for it is one thing for a <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> to be <hi>rotten,</hi> and another thing for him to have the <hi>rot.</hi> For a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> to be <hi>rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> is to have his inward parts waÅ¿ted and conÅ¿umed, or at leaÅ¿t Å¿o <hi>rotten,</hi> as never poÅ¿Å¿ibly to be recovered, to wit, his <hi>Liver, Lights,</hi> &amp;c. But for a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> to have the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e called the <hi>rot,</hi> I doe finde the Å¿ame to be either a formall <hi>aropÅ¿ie,</hi> or elÅ¿e a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e Å¿o allied neerly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as not to be diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed eaÅ¿ily: as we Å¿ay, a Sheep is <hi>rotten,</hi> when his <hi>Liver</hi> is become foule and tainted; nevertheleÅ¿Å¿e men doe eate the <hi>carkas,</hi> and doe averre it to be good meat, wherefore the Sheep is not rotten, but hath the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e called the <hi>rot.</hi> This malady commeth oft times to <hi>horÅ¿es</hi> unhandled, to wit, in their youth, whilÅ¿t they be yet Colts, which be bred, and do feed in <hi>Fenny-MarÅ¿h,</hi> and <hi>wet grounds,</hi> and Å¿ometimes it commeth to them after they have bin backed and ridden, when they haue too hard and violent riding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet but young, whereby the <hi>bloud</hi> is firÅ¿t enflamed, and after pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified and corrupted, begetting obÅ¿tructions in the <hi>Liver,</hi> and thoÅ¿e do cauÅ¿e putrefaction, and Å¿o knots and puÅ¿tils do engender in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> which breedeth either a <hi>DropÅ¿ie,</hi> a <hi>Feltricke,</hi> or a <hi>rot.</hi> The Å¿ignes how to know this infirmity, are theÅ¿e: After his journeyes his <hi>hayre</hi> will <hi>Å¿tare</hi> his <hi>legges</hi> Å¿well and burn, and when you Å¿hall preÅ¿Å¿e the places Å¿woln with your finger, upon taking your finger away, there
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:7066:169"/> will remaine a pit or dint, hee will forbeare his meat very much, and when he doth eate, it will be without any <hi>Å¿tomacke</hi> or <hi>appetite,</hi> he will pant much, lift and beat in the <hi>flanks</hi> many times, he will Å¿well under the <hi>belly,</hi> neither will he caÅ¿t his <hi>coat</hi> in Å¿eaÅ¿onable time, when other <hi>HorÅ¿es</hi> that be Å¿ound do, and he will be Å¿o faint of <hi>body,</hi> as that he will become <hi>lunt,</hi> and utterly to have loÅ¿t his <hi>mettle.</hi> TheÅ¿e and Å¿uch like be the Å¿ymptomes of this malady. Now come I to the cure.</p>
                     <p>Let him firÅ¿t <hi>bleed</hi> well under the <hi>taile,</hi> then</p>
                     <p>Take of <hi>Mares-milke</hi> two quarts, if the Å¿ame may be had, if not,<note place="margin">Rot.</note> the like quantity of the milke of a <hi>red Cow,</hi> then take a lump of Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then take a young <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> of or about the age of foure yeares, and of colour blacke, if it may be, if not, then of Å¿ome other colour, run and chafe him about that he may <hi>Å¿weate</hi> much, then with a <hi>Å¿poone,</hi> or with Å¿ome other Å¿uch like inÅ¿trument, rake the <hi>Å¿weate</hi> from his <hi>head, necke, breaÅ¿t, backe, Å¿ides, ribbes, buttocks, legges,</hi> and in a word, from each part or <hi>member</hi> of the Å¿aid <hi>horÅ¿e,</hi> and get off the Å¿weat Å¿o much as you can poÅ¿Å¿ibly, and Å¿o put your Arement and your <hi>Å¿weat</hi> into the milke, which all being well mixed, give him this by equall portions three mornings together, till he hath taken it all, and let him drinke none other drinke after it in Å¿ixe or Å¿even houres, but immediately after his drink, let him be led forth into Å¿ome <hi>paÅ¿ture</hi> where other <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es</hi> be, the better to cauÅ¿e him to <hi>neeÅ¿e, Å¿tale, dung,</hi> and <hi>empty himÅ¿elfe;</hi> for it is very <hi>wholeÅ¿ome</hi> for him Å¿o to doe, before he either eate or drink. Having thus done, Å¿et him up warm and well littered, and if the Å¿eaÅ¿on do Å¿erve, give him of the green blades of Rye, if not, give him Barly Å¿teeped in milk three dayes, but renewed every day once. Then after every of theÅ¿e drinks, if you feele him cold in the <hi>paÅ¿terne joynts,</hi> or that he <hi>trippeth</hi> or <hi>Å¿tumbleth</hi> as you leade him in your <hi>hand,</hi> meddle no further with him, for that he is paÅ¿t cure, otherwiÅ¿e for nine dayes together, after morning and evening give him white wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely, unleÅ¿Å¿e now and then a Å¿weet MaÅ¿h, and Å¿ometimes give him milke with his white water, if the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> be not above nine years old, and Å¿o you may cure him: but if he be elder, this may prolong his life, whereby he may do the more Å¿ervice. This I never did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, but a <hi>Noble Knight,</hi> and a very friend told me, that he hath thus recovered Å¿undry <hi>HorÅ¿es</hi> which have beene viÅ¿ited with this diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.</p>

It followeth that we diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿e yet further the meanes how to diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h an old griefe, from a new taken Å¿traine or hurt, which without an exact Å¿crutiny, cannot eaÅ¿ily be diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, for oft times a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> hath gotten a Å¿traine, for which he is preÅ¿ently turned to graÅ¿Å¿e, where peradventure he runs the whole Summer, and Å¿o by that meanes Å¿eemeth to goe upright, till he be heated and Å¿trained anew, and then will it appeare again, howbeit upon his firÅ¿t riding it may not appeare: you have therefore three wayes whereby to finde our his lameneÅ¿Å¿e,<note place="margin">Three waies to finde out lameneÅ¿Å¿e.</note> in what <hi>joynt, limb,</hi> or <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> Å¿oever it lyeth. 1 The firÅ¿t way is to take him out of the Stable, and to cauÅ¿e him to be turned at the halters end on either hand Å¿uddenly and Å¿wiftly upon as hard a way as you can pick out, and if he have any ache, wrench, or griefe in his <hi>fore-parts,</hi> it will appeare, for that when he Å¿hall turne upon that hand in which the griefe is, you Å¿hall perceive him to favour that <hi>legge,</hi> and Å¿o like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e run both towards you and from you, eÅ¿pecially down a little yeelding hill, and if he have any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>herein the griefe reÅ¿ideth; but if you be not able to finde out his <hi>lameneÅ¿Å¿e</hi> this way. 2 Then your Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond way muÅ¿t be for you to take his <hi>backe,</hi> and to ride him out a good round trot or pace a full houre, or Å¿o long untill Å¿uch time as you have throughly heat him, then Å¿et him up, and let him Å¿tand quiet two or three houres, and then either take his backe againe, or
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7066:174"/> elÅ¿e turne him at the halters end as before, and by thus doing, you may diÅ¿cover the leaÅ¿t griefe that may be in him, eÅ¿pecially when you thus Å¿tir him, if it be done upon Å¿tony or hard ground, for then he can neither will or chooÅ¿e, but either to favour the member grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or elÅ¿e to hault right downe. 3 A third way we have, and that is, to know whether the griefe doth proceed from a hot or cold cauÅ¿e, for if it proceed from a hot cauÅ¿e, then will the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> hault moÅ¿t, when he is hot, and in the middeÅ¿t of his travell; but if it be of a cold cauÅ¿e, then will he hault leaÅ¿t whilÅ¿t he is hot and moÅ¿t rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and travelled, and moÅ¿t at his firÅ¿t Å¿etting forth, whilÅ¿t he is cold; and thus much for lameneÅ¿Å¿e and halting before.</p>
                     <p>Now you perceiving your <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> to hault, and that you be aÅ¿Å¿ured that his lameneÅ¿Å¿e is not before, then may you be confident it muÅ¿t be behinde, which being Å¿o, the griefe muÅ¿t of neceÅ¿Å¿ity be either in the foot, or in the nether joynt, in the paÅ¿terne, or in the legge, in the hamme, or in the hough, in the Å¿tifling place, or joynt, or in the hip. If the griefe be either in the legge, paÅ¿terne, or foot, if you doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve him well, you Å¿hall underÅ¿tand it by the very Å¿ame Å¿ignes which I have inculcated already in the legges, paÅ¿ternes, or feet, for that the Å¿ignes be the very Å¿ame; if it be in the bending of the hamme, you may then eaÅ¿ily know it to be a plaine Selander. If it be in the hough, then is it either a bone or bloud-Spaven, which is eaÅ¿ily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be diÅ¿cerned, or elÅ¿e it muÅ¿t come of Å¿ome blow, wrench, or Å¿traine, neither then will the Å¿welling eaÅ¿ily appeare, but you Å¿hall perceive it either by the Å¿tifneÅ¿Å¿e of the joynt, or elÅ¿e you Å¿hall finde the place to be hot and burning if the paine Å¿hall lye in the Å¿tifling place, it is manifeÅ¿tly diÅ¿covered by his gate, for then you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in his going, to caÅ¿t the Å¿tifle ioynt outward, and you may plainely Å¿ee the bone on the inÅ¿ide to be bigger then the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides, his toe will hardly touch the ground. If it be in the Hip, which is upon the Å¿ide of the buttock, and if the hurt or wrench be newly taken, you Å¿hall eaÅ¿ily know it, in that the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> will goe Å¿ide-long like a Crab, not being able Å¿o well to follow with the grieved legge as he can doe with the other. NotwithÅ¿tanding if it be a hurt taken, long before, you Å¿hall perceive the Hip to be falne lower then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the fleÅ¿h to Å¿hrinke, you may alÅ¿o perceive it the better, as by going up a hill, or upon yeelding ground, by reaÅ¿on he cannot goe with Å¿o great eaÅ¿e, as when he goeth upon even or plaine ground. But the better to diÅ¿cover in what part behinde the griefe lyeth, let his Keeper take him out of the Stable in a long raine or coller-haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and let him runne him in his hand the full length of the rayne, for that in which legge Å¿oever the griefe is, you Å¿hall perceive him to favour it, but if you finde him to goe upright, without favouring any legge, then let your man take his backe, and ride him out a good trot or hand gallop, till he be warmed, then Å¿et him up, and let him Å¿tand an houre or two till he be cold, then take him forth againe, and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7066:174"/> let your man trot him in his hand at the end of the Rayne as he did before, and thus you Å¿hall perceive him to hault and complaine, and well obÅ¿erving him and his gate or going, you may eaÅ¿ily finde the place grieved. And if any lameneÅ¿Å¿e whether before or behinde, doe proceed from any hot cauÅ¿e, then you Å¿hall beÅ¿t know it, for that the more you travell or exerciÅ¿e him, and the warmer he is, the more he will hault. But if his griefe Å¿hall proceed from any cold cauÅ¿e, then will he halt moÅ¿t, being cold after he hath been travelled and Å¿et up warme.</p>

The Å¿ignes to know this Malady is plaine, for that his paine will bee Å¿o great as that it will cauÅ¿e him oft to lye downe and tumble, as if he had the Bots. I will give you one onely Receipt which a famous <hi>French MariÅ¿hall</hi> gave me, with which I cured one <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> for that I had never occaÅ¿ion to practiÅ¿e it upon any Å¿ince, but I do hold it to be moÅ¿t Å¿overaigne in a caÅ¿e of this nature.</p>

                     <p>This is to be done many waies, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e we are come to treat of this cure, I hold it not amiÅ¿Å¿e to make you underÅ¿tand what a <hi>Å¿plent</hi> is, by what meanes it commeth, how to know it, and which way to cure the Å¿ame, and to take it cleane away. A <hi>Å¿plent</hi> is in the beginning, a very <hi>griÅ¿tle,</hi> howbeit if it be long let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, it will come to be a hard <hi>bone</hi> or <hi>excreÅ¿ion,</hi> and then it will not be Å¿o eaÅ¿ily cured.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7066:180"/> was; it taketh its reÅ¿idence for the moÅ¿t part upon the inÅ¿ide of the <hi>Å¿hanke</hi> about the middle thereof, but Å¿ometimes again higher e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven adjoyning to the <hi>knee,</hi> which if it be there, then it is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile to cure. It will many times cauÅ¿e the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> to hault, but howÅ¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it will make him oft to <hi>Å¿tumble,</hi> and to <hi>trip,</hi> and many times to <hi>fall</hi> in his travell. Sometimes it commeth to a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> hereditarily, like as doth the <hi>Å¿paven,</hi> and other Å¿orances and maladies: as if either the <hi>Stalion</hi> or <hi>Mare</hi> be viÅ¿ited therewith, as I have formerly intimated.

                     <p>FirÅ¿t waÅ¿h the place with warme water, and Å¿have away the <hi>hayre,</hi> then with your <hi>inciÅ¿ion knife</hi> Å¿lit a hole cleane through the <hi>skin,</hi> more then the length of a Barly corne, and then convey into the Å¿aid hole Å¿o much <hi>ArÅ¿nicke</hi> as the fourth part of a haÅ¿le Nut, which muÅ¿t be bound on with a boulÅ¿ter and rowler of linnen, and made faÅ¿t with a needle and threed, and Å¿o let remaine untouched three whole daies and nights, in which time the <hi>ArÅ¿nicke</hi> will eate and corrode cleane away the <hi>Å¿plent,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Splent.</note> then to kill the fire, anoint the place (having firÅ¿t ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the rowler and boulÅ¿ter, and waÅ¿hed cleane the Å¿orance) with Å¿weet or freÅ¿h Butter molten, eight or ten dayes after, and it will be whole. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> With this I have done very many cures of this kinde.

                     <p>FirÅ¿t waÅ¿h and Å¿have away the <hi>hayre,</hi> then <hi>knock, rubbe,</hi> and <hi>pricke</hi> it with your <hi>bloud Å¿taffe</hi> and <hi>fleame,</hi> and after you have Å¿o done, rub and knock it again, then</p>
                     <p>Take Vervine and Salt, of each one handfull, pound them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to an Vnguent, and apply it to the place, and binde it up with a rowler Å¿titched on faÅ¿t with a needle and threed, and Å¿o let it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine foure and twenty houres, and then unbinde it, and it is cured without any more to doe. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good.

                     <p>After you have waÅ¿hed and Å¿haven, knocked, rubbed, and laid it open, as before is taught you, take a head of Garlicke, picked and pilled, three or foure drops of the beÅ¿t white Wine Vineger, a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weight of greene Coppras, all well beaten together, apply it to the <hi>Å¿plent,</hi> and then bind and Å¿tich it up, and let it lye on foure and twenty houres, then open it, and if the <hi>Å¿plent</hi> be not taken quite away, make more of the Å¿ame Medicine, and adminiÅ¿ter it againe, binding it up as before, and after other foure and twenty houres take of the medicine, and then you Å¿hall need do nothing more unto him, but only what you are preÅ¿cribed in the precedent cure.

                     <p>Take MuÅ¿tard Å¿eed, and beat it, and let it Å¿teepe a little in fayre water, and after make a PlaiÅ¿ter thereof, and lay it to the place, and three dayes after take it away, but have a care your <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> come not unto it with his teeth, the <hi>hayre</hi> alÅ¿o being Å¿haven away before you do apply your PlaiÅ¿ter, and this will cure him.

                     <p>Take Auripigmentum made into fine powder, and lay it upon the <hi>Splent,</hi> and it will take it off; but beware that this powder doe touch neither <hi>veine</hi> nor <hi>Å¿inew,</hi> for it is a very coroding thing, <g ref="char:cross">â</g>.

                     <p>This inconvenience commeth many wayes, Å¿ometimes it commeth <hi>naturally,</hi> and Å¿ometimes <hi>accidentally,</hi> it commeth <hi>naturally</hi> by reaÅ¿on the <hi>Å¿inewes</hi> of the <hi>fore-legs</hi> are Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Å¿traight, Å¿o that the <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> is not able to handle his <hi>legges</hi> with that dexterity and agility he Å¿hould, and the onely remedy to cure him of this defect is, to cut him of the Cords (as we terme it) <hi>viz.</hi> by cuting a Å¿lit upon the very top of his <hi>noÅ¿e,</hi> and with your <hi>cornet</hi> to take up the two great <hi>Å¿inewes</hi> which you Å¿hall there finde, and Å¿o cut them in Å¿under, and after to heale it up againe with Å¿ome healing Salve, and this will doe him no harme, but good, for by this doing, it will give him the uÅ¿e of his <hi>legges</hi> Å¿o perfectly, as that he will Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never after <hi>trip</hi> any more, and this can every ordinary Smith doe. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> And my counÅ¿ell is, that when at any time you

The Å¿econd cauÅ¿e that maketh a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> to <hi>Å¿tumble,</hi> is <hi>accidentall,</hi> and this commeth either by meanes of the putting forth of a <hi>Å¿plent,</hi> or a <hi>ridge bone,</hi> or about <hi>wind gals,</hi> or by Å¿ome detriment taken in the <hi>foot,</hi> as by being hot, foundred, prickt, Å¿tubd, graveld, or the like, or by Å¿ome <hi>Å¿inew Å¿praine,</hi> or Å¿ome hurt or wrench in the <hi>Å¿houlder,</hi> or by Å¿ome pinch in the <hi>withers;</hi> and it commeth alÅ¿o by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-riding, and then negligently Å¿et up, which cauÅ¿eth him to goe <hi>Å¿tiffe,</hi> and then the cure muÅ¿t be done with <hi>bathes</hi> and <hi>unguents,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Å¿tretch, Å¿upple, mollifie, and to comfort the Å¿tiffe <hi>members,</hi> for remedy and eaÅ¿e whereof, I have given you very many good <hi>receits</hi> before preÅ¿cribed you, as well of <hi>bathes</hi> as of <hi>unguents.</hi> But yet I will give you one more which I have often made uÅ¿e of, and have done much good therewith for Å¿tiffe legges,<note place="margin">Stiffe legge</note>

                        <note place="margin">Of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</note> but the true name thereof is the <hi>Stavers,</hi> it is a dizzineÅ¿Å¿e in the <hi>head,</hi> neerly allyed unto the <hi>frenzy</hi> when it Å¿eazeth the <hi>braine.</hi> It is ingendred Å¿ometimes of corrupt <hi>bloud,</hi> and heavy and bad <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> which do intoxicate and oppreÅ¿Å¿e the <hi>braine.</hi> It is a diÅ¿eaÅ¿e inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to almoÅ¿t every <hi>horÅ¿e,</hi> yea and that moÅ¿t dangerous if it be not Å¿oone eÅ¿pied. Sometimes it commeth by feeding and grazing, at what time the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> is hard ridden, that he be hot and Å¿weateth, for by his feeding and holding down his head Å¿o low as to graze upon the ground, the <hi>peccant humours</hi> doe fall down to the <hi>head,</hi> and there Å¿ettle, and in Å¿hort time Å¿eazeth the <hi>braine,</hi> which bringeth this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall diÅ¿eaÅ¿e.

                        <note place="margin">Stavers.</note> and that you be in Å¿uch a place, where for the preÅ¿ent you can get no help, then thruÅ¿t up the greater end of your riding rod into either <hi>noÅ¿trill</hi> good and hard, cauÅ¿ing him thereby to <hi>bleed</hi> well, and this will preÅ¿erve him for the time, till you come where you may meet with better remedy: then take a piece of Wheaten lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, bay Salt, Rue, Aqua vitae, and Å¿trong white Wine Vineger, of each as much as will Å¿uffice, bray all theÅ¿e in a Å¿tone morter very well, then put this medicine into two thin fine linnen clothes or rags,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:7066:183"/> by equall portions, and then moiÅ¿ten it well in the liquor, and Å¿o convey thoÅ¿e clouts into either of his <hi>eares</hi> one, and then Å¿titch them up cloÅ¿e, that he get not the medicine forth, but that the Å¿ubÅ¿tance thereof may be diffuÅ¿ed into his <hi>head,</hi> and let the medicine remaine Å¿o foure and twenty hours, then take forth the rags, and this will make him a Å¿ound and whole <hi>horÅ¿e.</hi>

                     <p>This miÅ¿chiefe commeth <hi>accidentally,</hi> to wit, either by a <hi>Å¿traine</hi> in leaping, or by a Å¿lip in travell, or by the Å¿troke of Å¿ome other <hi>horÅ¿e,</hi> and thus the <hi>bone</hi> is either out of its place, or elÅ¿e the joynt is very much Å¿trained or hurt. The Å¿ignes to know it is; if the <hi>bone</hi> be out, you may Å¿ee it plainely, for beÅ¿ides his hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the <hi>bone</hi> diÅ¿located will Å¿o Å¿tick out, as that the <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> can do no more then touch the ground with his <hi>toe,</hi> til it be put in again, and the way to put it in is thus. FirÅ¿t tye down his head to the Manger, then take a cord and faÅ¿ten it to the <hi>paÅ¿terne</hi> of the <hi>Å¿tifled</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Stifled.</note> 
                        <hi>legge,</hi> and draw his <hi>legge</hi> forwards, and Å¿o the bone will come right by helping it with your <hi>hand,</hi> which being in, your care then muÅ¿t be to keep it in with your <hi>hand,</hi> and then tye the other end of the cord to the Rack, Å¿o as he may not put back his <hi>legge</hi> to diÅ¿locate the <hi>bone</hi> any more for an houre or two after till it be Å¿etled and dreÅ¿Å¿ed. Wherefore let his <hi>Keeper</hi> Å¿tand by him all the time, leÅ¿t the <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> Å¿hould lye down, or be unruly. This done, take pitch which you muÅ¿t have molten in a pot, in a readineÅ¿Å¿e, and with a clout upon a Å¿tick annoint the Å¿tifling three or foure inches broad at the leaÅ¿t, and ten inches long, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ently before the pitch can coole, have a Å¿trong piece of new Canvas cut fit for the purpoÅ¿e, which being made very warme by a fire, clap it upon the place Å¿o neatly, that the <hi>bone</hi> cannot goe forth againe. This plaiÅ¿ter muÅ¿t not lye towards the <hi>flanke</hi> and <hi>foot</hi> longÅ¿t-wayes, but croÅ¿Å¿e-wayes upon the <hi>joynt,</hi> as it were about the <hi>thigh,</hi> otherwiÅ¿e it cannot hold in the <hi>bone.</hi> Having thus done, anoint the plaiÅ¿ter on the out-Å¿ide all over with the Å¿aid molten pitch, and whilÅ¿t it is warm, clap flocks of the <hi>horÅ¿es</hi> colour all over upon the out-Å¿ide of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas, and let the plaiÅ¿ter remaine on untill it fall away of it Å¿elfe, and after that you may apply Å¿uch good Vnguents as you may thinke to be moÅ¿t expedient for the malady. But if the <hi>bone</hi> be not out, then put in a <hi>French Rowell</hi> a little beneath the Å¿tifling-place, and let the <hi>Rowell</hi> remain in fifteen dayes, turning it once every day, and at fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes end take it forth, and heale up the <hi>orifice,</hi> like as before you have been taught. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is Å¿peciall good.</p>

                     <p>Of this I have Å¿poken a little already, where I did remit you to this place.

                     <p>Take two of the greateÅ¿t roots of Polipodium you can get from the Oke, waÅ¿h and Å¿crape them very cleane, and tye it to his Snaffle,<note place="margin">Vomiting.</note> Trench, or Bit, then let it be Å¿teeped in the oyle of Spike a whole night, and in the morning faÅ¿ting put on his bridle with the Å¿aid roots, and ride him with it in his mouth an houre or better faire and Å¿oftly, and if he be troubled with any rhumaticke or phlegmaticke humour, or with any cold or other filthy matter which may any way peÅ¿ter, clogge, or annoy his Å¿tomacke; this thing will force him to vent them at his mouth and noÅ¿e, and it wil cauÅ¿e him to cough and neeze, whereby he will Å¿end forth a great abundance of filth and evill Å¿limy Å¿tuffe from off his Å¿tomacke and head, as that in Å¿hort time he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very cleane in his body, for this will both refine his bloud, and exhauÅ¿t all his watry humours, in Å¿uch Å¿ort as by temperate ordering him, and doing as I have here preÅ¿cribed you, you may be confident to keep him a long Å¿ound, perfect, and Å¿erviceable <hi>horÅ¿e.</hi> And this is not to be applied onely to a <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> newly taken from graÅ¿Å¿e, but to any other <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> that hath taken a cold, or to any ketty, foule, foggy, or purÅ¿ive <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> whatÅ¿oever. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This may Å¿eeme Å¿trange here

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:7066:192"/> to hold all the Ingredients, and put alÅ¿o all thoÅ¿e living-creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them alive, and then make a Cake of Clay, and therewith lute up the Pot Å¿o cloÅ¿e, as that neyther Å¿moake nor ayre can eyther get in or out; having Å¿o done carry your Pot into Å¿ome Orchard or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther CloÅ¿e, or Back-Å¿ide, from HouÅ¿ing or Straw, and there place it, and Å¿o make a great fire both round about it, and upon it, and Å¿o keep the fire unto the Pot, till it bee as red-hot as the very fiery-coles themÅ¿elves, and let the fire continue Å¿o great after the pot is red-hot by the Å¿pace of halfe an hour at the leaÅ¿t: then let the fire remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched untill it be all conÅ¿umed to aÅ¿hes, and Å¿o go forth of it Å¿elfe, without eyther quenching the Å¿ame, or taking away any of the fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and Å¿o let it Å¿tand till it be through cold, which will hardly be done the Å¿ame day, Å¿o when the Pot is through cold, take it from the place, and opening it, take forth the Å¿tuffe, and put it into Å¿ome Trough or great Morter made for the purpoÅ¿e, which muÅ¿t Å¿tand in Å¿ome out or open place where no winde can come, the Trough or Morter being covered with a cloth, that the powder may not fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there pound and Å¿tamp theÅ¿e things together into fine powder, and in the Å¿tamping, adde thereunto of unÅ¿lacked-Lime one pound.

                        <hi>Wind gaules</hi> are terrible Sorances, which do breed in the <hi>legges</hi> of a <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> as well on the outÅ¿ide as on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide, a little above the <hi>Fet-locke ioynt,</hi> and by their Å¿welling are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diÅ¿covered, and made viÅ¿ible to the <hi>Eye,</hi> for they bee bladders, wherein lyeth a Ielly, which being let forth is thicke, and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the yolke of an Egge, whereof Å¿ome will be bigger, and Å¿ome leÅ¿Å¿er. It commeth moÅ¿t commoly to <hi>HorÅ¿es</hi> in the Summer-time, by reaÅ¿on they are ridden upon hard ground, and the <hi>HorÅ¿e</hi> being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-heat by too hard riding, his greaÅ¿e falleth downe into his <hi>legges,</hi> and Å¿etleth there, and by that meanes breedeth this Malady, wee call <hi>Wind-gaules,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wind-galles</note> and they will be Å¿o painefull unto him, as to cauÅ¿e him many times to halt. The Å¿ignes to know them are by the Å¿wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in that place before named, which be moÅ¿t eaÅ¿ie to be Å¿een and felt. The cure is eyther to Å¿tricke with your Fleame or to open them with your InciÅ¿ion-knife, and to let and cruÅ¿h out all the congealed Å¿tuffe which is therein, opening the place no further then through the <hi>skin,</hi> and you muÅ¿t be carefull of the <hi>Å¿inew,</hi> which lyeth cloÅ¿e to that place: then.</p>
                     <p>Take the white of an Egge, and Oyle-de Bay Å¿o much as will Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, incorporate them together, and apply it with Hurds PlaiÅ¿ter-wiÅ¿e, and in three or foure dayes thus dreÅ¿Å¿ing it, he will be cured. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. Thus have I cured many <hi>HorÅ¿es.</hi> Another. After you have let forth the Ielly.</p>
                     <p>Take Pitch, RoÅ¿in, and MaÅ¿ticke, of each like much, boyl or but
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7066:193"/> melt them together, and as it cooleth, make it up into rowles bigger or leÅ¿Å¿er at your pleaÅ¿ure, and being thorough cold, apply it with a hot iron to the orifice, and Å¿o round about the place of the Å¿orance on either Å¿ide of the legge, and Å¿o Å¿oon as you have layed on this charge, and before it can be cold, clap on Flocks, and this will dry up the Wind-gaules, and heale them. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is Å¿peciall good. But during not onely theÅ¿e two cures, but all other for this malady, you muÅ¿t not Å¿uffer your <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> to come into any Well by any means. Another. FirÅ¿t Å¿have away the hayre as you muÅ¿t doe in all theÅ¿e kinde of cures, then open the Å¿orance as before is taught you, and cruÅ¿h forth the jelly and filth, then</p>
                     <p>Take Tacha-Mahacha, MaÅ¿ticke, ParroÅ¿in, of each to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a haÅ¿le nut, and of Stone-Pitch to the quantity of a Wall-nut, with a little BrimÅ¿tone powdred, melt all theÅ¿e together, and when it is molten, put in Å¿o much Turpentine as a Wall-nut, and Å¿o Å¿tirre them together, and when it is cold, make a plaiÅ¿ter thereof upon lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and apply it warme to the place upon the out-Å¿ide onely upon the orifice, which ought evermore to be made on the out-Å¿ide, then put on the plaiÅ¿ter it Å¿elfe, and round about it with the Å¿ame Salve, and clap Flocks upon it, and Å¿o let him reÅ¿t in the Stable, and by kee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping him from wet till he be whole, and let the plaiÅ¿ter remaine on untill it Å¿hall fall away of it Å¿elfe <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is a moÅ¿t excellent cure, and I have often made good uÅ¿e thereof. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take the oyle of Vineger, and dip your thumb therein, and rub the Å¿orance therewith every day till the haire do fall off, which will cauÅ¿e the Wind-gaules to breake, run, and bleed, then heale and cure the Wind-gaules well and Å¿oundly. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is as good as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Another. WaÅ¿h and Å¿have as formerly is Å¿hewed you, then give fire to the place, that done, open the Wind-gaules juÅ¿t in the middle line or Å¿troke, halfe an inch at leaÅ¿t, and Å¿o cruÅ¿h forth the jelly with your thumb, then</p>
                     <p>Take Pitch, RoÅ¿in, and MaÅ¿tick, of each like much, and therewith charge the place as before is taught you. This is very good. Another. FirÅ¿t waÅ¿h and Å¿have, and open the place with your fleame, &amp;c. then take of oyle de Bay, and of Turpentine, of each one Å¿poonfull, Verdigrece in fine powder, one penny worth, the white of an Egge, and of red Leade two ounces in powder, boyle all theÅ¿e to a Salve, and adminiÅ¿ter it to the place plaiÅ¿ter-wiÅ¿e. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is one of the beÅ¿t cures for Wind-gaules that I doe know.</p>

                     <p>This is a thing that I have handled before, yet I will give you a few more receits. Having travelled him, and comming home, or to your Inne, when you take off the Å¿addle, and that you doe finde the <hi>horÅ¿e</hi> to be wrung in the <hi>withers,</hi> and his backe or <hi>withers</hi> thereby to be Å¿welled, immediately clap on the Saddle againe, and lay upon the Å¿wolne place Å¿ome wet litter, and Å¿o let the Saddle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide on againe;<note place="margin">Wither-wrung.</note> then cut up a thin Turfe of graÅ¿Å¿e and earth together, that done, put the Turfe upon the fire, and let it there remaine till it becommeth red hot, and being well burned, take it from the fire, and moiÅ¿ten the graÅ¿Å¿y Å¿ide very well with white Wine Vineger, then take off the wet litter, and lay the Turfe very hot with the graÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿y-Å¿ide next to the place, and Å¿o put on the Saddle againe, and let it Å¿o remaine for all night, and this preÅ¿ently helpeth any Å¿wellings in the <hi>withers,</hi> or any other part of the backe, as alÅ¿o any Å¿wellings by Spur-gaules or Navell-gaules. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good. Another. If the skin be broken or ulcerated, then</p>
                     <p>Take Å¿weet Butter, Bay-Å¿alt, and powder of FrankincenÅ¿e, of each as much as will Å¿uffice, boile all theÅ¿e upon the fire, and with a clowt faÅ¿tened to the end of a Å¿ticke, even as it commeth boyling from the fire, Å¿cald it two or three times, but if it be full of corruption, then make inciÅ¿ion on both Å¿ides from beneath, that the matterative Å¿tuffe may the more eaÅ¿ily void away downewards, and after uÅ¿e none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing wherewith to heale it up, but onely your uÅ¿uall powder of Lime and Honey, which will heale that, or dry other Å¿uch like hurts. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is moÅ¿t excellent, I have often experimented the Å¿ame. Another. But if it be a wrinckle either in the Å¿houlder, or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joynt or member, then</p>
                     <p>Take of white Wine one pinte, halfe a porringer full of Wheate flower, of common Honey one pinte, of Syzes three ounces, boyle all theÅ¿e together to an Vnguent, and anoint the places grieved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.

                        <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This I often uÅ¿ing have found it to be very good. Another.</p>
                     <p>Take three great Onyons, picke forth the cores, making a conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or hollowneÅ¿Å¿e in them, then fill them up with the powder of FrankincenÅ¿e, then wrap them up in three or four handfuls of Hurds or Tow, then wet the Hurds, and Å¿o cover and heale them up in the hot embers, and lay upon the top of the embers a good Shovell-full of hot burning coles, and Å¿o let it remaine untill the Onions be throughly roÅ¿ted, then take them forth, and Å¿eparate the Hurds and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7066:194"/> burned part from the other, and the Å¿oft and pappy part you Å¿hall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Å¿orance very hot, and let it remain three daies before it be removed, and do thus Å¿o oft as need Å¿hall require, untill it be through whole; but unleÅ¿Å¿e the hurt or bruiÅ¿e be very great, it will be cured at firÅ¿t dreÅ¿Å¿ing. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good. Another. But if the place grieved be broken,</p>
                     <p>Take then of the oyle of Worms, of Turpentine, and common Honey, of each two ounces, incorporate all theÅ¿e together very well till you have brought them to be one body, and either by Taint or PlaiÅ¿ter dreÅ¿Å¿e the Å¿orance therewith, and it will heale it up Å¿ound. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> And this alÅ¿o is very good. Another. If your HorÅ¿e hath taken a wre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ch in the Å¿houlder, or in the hippe, knee, or hoofe; then firÅ¿t Å¿wim him, then after for thirteen or fourteen dayes together, annoynt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber grieved all over, and a good way about with this unguent.</p>
                     <p>Take of the oyle de Bay, of Nervall, of Dialthea, of tryed Hogs greaÅ¿e, of each two ounces, melt all theÅ¿e together, and Å¿tirre them well till they be well incorporated, and herewith anoint him againÅ¿t the haire, with a hot bar of iron to be holden before you as you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint him. and after let him be rowelled with a <hi>French</hi> Rowell, and let a Patten-Å¿hooe be put upon the contrary foot, and let him be kept in the houÅ¿e, and the Rowell turned daily, and the corruption put forth, and then let him be either gently ridden or walked every day halfe an houre, and let the Rowell remain in the HorÅ¿e fourteen daies at the leaÅ¿t, then take it out, and heale up the orifice with your green Oyntment, and Å¿o Å¿oon as he is whole, with your cauterizing-iron draw croÅ¿Å¿e lines eight or nine inches long over againÅ¿t the joynt that was pained, Å¿o as the rowelled place may be in the middle, but yet burn him no deeper then that the skin may look yellow, and then charge all that place with this charge.</p>
                     <p>Take Pitch one pound, RoÅ¿in halfe a pound, and Tarre half a pint, melt theÅ¿e together, and whilÅ¿t it is warm, charge the place therwith, and clap Flocks upon the charge, and then if the Å¿eaÅ¿on of the yeare will Å¿erve, let him be turned to graÅ¿Å¿e, and Å¿o let him run three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths at the leaÅ¿t. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good.</p>

                     <p>This diÅ¿eaÅ¿e of the <hi>Yellowes</hi> in a HorÅ¿e is the very Å¿ame that PhyÅ¿itians do call the Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿e in a man; and as there be two Å¿orts of Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿e in a man, Å¿o alÅ¿o are there the like in a HorÅ¿e, <hi>viz.</hi> the Yellow and the Black, the yellow being moyÅ¿t, the black dry; the yellow proceeding from the over-flowing of the gall, occaÅ¿ioned of choller, and the black comming from the over-working of the Spleen, by means of over-much malancholy, both bad infirmities, but the black worÅ¿t, more dangerous and moÅ¿t mortall, the yellow is more eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by reaÅ¿on of its colour, for it coloureth the whites of the eyes, the tongue, the lips, and the inward parts of the noÅ¿trils, which the black IaundiÅ¿e doth not apparantly, albeit by due and Å¿trict obÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you may come to know when your HorÅ¿e hath a black Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diÅ¿e, for then you Å¿hall perceive the whites of his eyes, lips, tongue, and mouth to be of a thick and duskiÅ¿h colour, and not Å¿o cleere and Å¿anguine as before when he was not viÅ¿ited with any Å¿uch infirmity, both which are Å¿o mortall (eÅ¿pecially the latter) as that if very great care be not taken whereby to pry into its Å¿ymptomes, the HorÅ¿e may
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7066:195"/> fall downe upon a Å¿udden (as I have often Å¿een and known) even as he travelleth, and dye, or elÅ¿e he appearing to be Å¿ound and healthy, and to eate his meat like as he was accuÅ¿tomed over night when you left him, comming again unto him in the morning, you may finde him dead, Å¿tiffe, and cold. And the origen of this malady commeth principally of unkindely and unnaturall heats given him by moÅ¿t vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and intemperate riding, whereby the Liver becommeth infla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med; the Liver, the Bloud, Gall, and the Spleen, which cauÅ¿eth choller to have Å¿overaignty and dominion over the other humours, and Å¿o engendreth this perilous diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, which Å¿eldome bringeth a lingring or languiÅ¿hing death, but that which endeth him Å¿uddenly, and therefore it is moÅ¿t requiÅ¿ite that the greater eye and care be had unto it. The beÅ¿t Å¿ymptomes how to know it is thus. Your HorÅ¿e will be dry in his body, mouth, and noÅ¿trils, being marvellous hot through the abundance of choller that reigneth in him, and he will be very gaunt in his belly towards the flanks, he will be alÅ¿o very faint, and not onely Å¿weat upon every the leaÅ¿t motion, but alÅ¿o as he Å¿tandeth in the Stable: his eyes, the inÅ¿ides of his lips, mouth, and tongue, will be yellow as Saffron, and he will Å¿eldome lye down, and being layd, he will Å¿ometimes grone. The cure. FirÅ¿t let him bloud in the neck and mouth, and let him bleed well, then give him this drink.</p>
                     <p>Take of Turmerick and long Pepper, of each one penniworth,<note place="margin">Yellowes.</note> AnniÅ¿eeds and Licoris in fine powder and Å¿earced, of each halfe a Å¿poonfull, Selendine, the leaves and roots one handfull chop, Å¿tamp, and Å¿traine the Selendine, and Å¿o put all theÅ¿e together into Å¿trong Ale one quart, warm this upon the fire, and in the warming adde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it of London Treacle one ounce, and of Å¿weet Butter the quantity of an Egge, and give it him bloud warm, and after keep him warme, and give him white water, and he will do well. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good. Another. FirÅ¿t bloudy him as before, and then</p>
                     <p>Take Turmerick, Myrrah, Ivory or Harts-horn, of each halfe an ounce, Saffron one penny worth, make all theÅ¿e into fine powder, and Å¿earce them, and put unto it of the juyce of Selendine a good quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, put all theÅ¿e into Muskadine one pinte, Sack or Ale, and let it boile upon the fire a walm or two, then put unto it of Å¿weet Butter as much as will Å¿uffice, and of <hi>London</hi> Treacle one ounce, and Å¿o give it him bloud warm, but let him firÅ¿t be raked. This is very good. Another. FirÅ¿t bloudy him as before, then</p>
                     <p>Take of white wine one quart, of Saffron two drams, and of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick halfe an ounce, and a good quantity of the juyce of Selendine; give him this bloud warm, and keep him warm, and give him white water. <g ref="char:cross">â</g> This is very good. Another. FirÅ¿t let him bloud as you are preÅ¿cribed before. Then</p>
                     <p>Take of Å¿weete Wine one pinte, of Å¿tronge Ale and Beere one quart, and put unto it of the iuyce of Salendine Å¿ix Å¿poonefuls, and of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7066:196"/> the iuyce of Rue two Å¿poonefuls, and let all theÅ¿e boyle upon the fire a little, then Å¿traine into it of <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Saffaron halfe an ounce, and put into it of life hony three ounces, and Å¿o give it him bloud-warme, then leap his backe, and Å¿o ride or elÅ¿e walke him a foot-pace a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre, then Å¿et him up warme, letting him to faÅ¿t three houres after, and after give him meat, and a Å¿weete MaÅ¿h, or white-water. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. This is very good. Another. Bloudy him as before. Then</p>
                     <p>Take of the beÅ¿t life hony halfe a pound, of Saffaron made into fine powder, and of the powder of Fenugrick of each Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, incorporate theÅ¿e with your Hony to a Å¿tiffe paÅ¿te, and Å¿o make thereof three Pils, and dipping them into Salet-oyle give them to your <hi>HorÅ¿e,</hi> which after he hath taken, ride or walke him gently an houre, then Å¿et him up warme, and order him as before. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. This is a particular good Pill. Another. FirÅ¿t let him bloud as before; Then</p>
                     <p>Take of white-Wine one quart or Ale to the Å¿ame quantity, and put therein of Saffaron one ounce, and Turmerick one ounce, both made into fine powder, with the iuyce of Salendine Å¿o much as will Å¿uffice, and give him this bloud-warme, and order him as before. <g ref="char:cross">â</g>. This is alÅ¿o very good.</p>
